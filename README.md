## Software Requirements

* Pelican 3.3
* ghp-import
* Markdown 2.3.1

## Gentle introduction to Pelican

Pelican's [QUICKSTART](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html) page is a good place to learn about the basics of Pelican (installation, project skeleton, development cycle, etc.).

## Installation instructions 

Two types of installations are documented: a regular one, and one that creates a virtual environment via Vagrant.

### Regular installation
To run a development server on your local computer, follow these basic steps:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/xsf/xmpp.org.git
# install Pelican and dependencies
cd xmpp.org
```

Running the server in development mode:

```bash
make serve
```

If you want the server to autoreload whenever a file change, you can instead do:

```bash
make devserver
```

View at `http://localhost:8000`

### Docker-based installation

The Makefile will build the website completely by running `make -f MakefileDocker`. It'll do
the following:

* Create a build Docker image (`make builder`) which is a development
environment with a complete set of dependencies ready.

* Run this docker image on the xmpp.org directory locally. This directory
is presumed to contain a checked out repository for the website. (`make site`)

* From the newly created static files in `deploy/output`, it will then create
a minimalist docker image to actually serve the website. (`make deployer`)

For development convenience, you can run the website on port 8080 by `make -f MakefileDocker serve`

### Vagrant-based installation
For your convenience, this repository ships with a basic Vagrantfile, which allows you to create virtual machine with all the dependencies required for local development.

Assuming your computer has [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed, the following will get you a running server:
```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/xsf/xmpp.org.git
cd xmpp.org
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
make devserver
```

Now, the wesite should be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Configuration

```
<repo>
  fabfile.py
  develop_server.sh
  Makefile
  README.md
  pelicanconf.py (development configuration)
  publishconf.py (production configuration)
  output
    <generated files - published to gh-pages branch>
  content
    pages
      <website page files>
  pelican-bootstrap3
    <website theme>
```

## Site generation

To just generate a new version (without starting up a local webserver) just do:

`make html`


Theme development
-----------------

You can modify the theme (layout and styling) in the [xmpp.org-theme](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/tree/master/xmpp.org-theme/sass) directory.

Make changes to Sass files, *not* compiled CSS.

`npm i` then run `grunt` to compile Sass.
