### Help us to build the newsletter

We are drafting every month’s newsletter in  [a pull request](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [XSF Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort.

To add your article, news or event you have three ways to contribute. For each of them we are asking you to write a short summary of the content you would like to contribute and post it to one of the following:

* the [online pad](https://pad.nixnet.services/oHnY_ZvLT8SoFyCqIC2ung)
* the [XSF Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join)
* the current [newsletter pull request](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3)
