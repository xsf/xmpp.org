## XSF Announcements

- The XSF members have to elected their new [XSF Board and XSF Council](https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council)! Congratulations to everyone!

- The XSF offers [fiscal hosting](https://xmpp.org/community/fiscalhost/) for XMPP projects now! Please apply via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/xmpp). For more information, see the [announcement blog post](https://xmpp.org/2021/09/the-xsf-as-a-fiscal-host/).

    - Moreover, the XSF has accepted its first project to the fiscal hosting program! A big welcome to the [MAM Plugin for XMPP.js](https://gitlab.com/deblounge/xmppjs-mam-plugin) (note that this is unaffiliated with the upstream [xmpp.js](https://github.com/xmppjs/xmpp.js) project)! They will be working on adding MAM support to xmpp.js with the eventual goal of adding it to the Matrix Bifrost bridge, allowing XMPP users to fetch history from their favorite Matrix channels. You can [donate to the effort here](https://opencollective.com/bifrost-mam).

- The XSF is planning to participate the Google Summer of Code 2022 (GSoC). If you are interested in participating as a student, mentor or as project in general please [add your ideas and reach out to us](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Google_Summer_of_Code_2022)!

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

-   No new XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2022)
    -   Rename Advanced Server and Advanced Client to Server and Client
    -   Add XEP-0455 to Future Development section (sp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Stable (formerly known as Draft)

Info: The XSF has decided to rename 'Draft' to 'Stable'. [Read more about it here.](https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1100)

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2022)
    -   Advance to Draft as per Council Vote from 2021-11-03. (XEP Editor (jsc))

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0313](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) (Message Archive Management)
    -   Advance to Stable as per Council Vote from 2021-10-27. (XEP Editor (jsc))

### Deprecated

-   No XEP deprecated this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. We really need more support!

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience!
And even if you can only spend a few minutes of support, these would already be helpful!

Tasks we do on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German, French, Italian and Spanish
