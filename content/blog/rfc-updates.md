We continue to make incremental modifications to [RFC 3920](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt) and [RFC 3921](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3921.txt), the core specifications of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Most of these modifications are relatively minor clarifications or reflect implementation and deployment experience our community has gained since the XMPP RFCs were published in 2004.

Today we submitted updated ("-02") versions of [rfc3920bis](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-02.html) and [rfc3921bis](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3921bis-02.html) to the IETF. The diffs from the "-01" versions are fairly small -- see [here](http://tinyurl.com/yrys6d) and [here](http://tinyurl.com/23v9dz) for details.
