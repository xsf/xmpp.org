A quick report from day 1 of FOSDEM. The Dev room was packed for virtually every session (standing room only as you can see from a selection of pictures below) and every talk, despite problems with the FOSDEM wi-fi, was well received.

We'll hopefully post short summaries of the talks at a later date once the speakers have recovered from their hangovers and/or stopped eating bacon.
