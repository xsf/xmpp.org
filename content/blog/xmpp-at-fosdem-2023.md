We're very excited to be back at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) in person this year. Once again, many members of the XMPP community will
be attending, and we hope to see you there!

### Realtime Lounge

As usual, we will have the *Realtime Lounge* set up, where you can come and meet community members, project developers, see demos and
ask us questions. ~~Note that this year we will be in a slightly different location to usual - on the ground floor of the [K building](https://fosdem.org/2023/stands/).~~

**Update:** We'll be in our traditional location - find us on the K building 2nd floor, beside the elevator (map below).
Come and say hi!

### Talks

There will also be multiple talks in the [Real Time Communications devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/real_time_communications/)
that relate to XMPP. These are all on Sunday afternoon:

- [Interoperable Chat, Dutch Healthcare and the Digital Services Act](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/interoperable_chat/)
  Winfried shares the many challenges faced while working on a standard for interopable chat in healthcare that's compatible with the EU's new regulations.
- [P10K: getting 10000 participants into a Jitsi meeting](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/jitsi_p10k/)  
  Sa√∫l from the Jitsi team will reveal their interesting journey to reach 10000 participants in an XMPP-powered Jitsi video conference.
- [Modernizing Authentication and Authorization in XMPP](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/modern_xmpp_auth/)
  Matthew, founder of the Prosody and Snikket projects, explains why it's time for us to look beyond passwords for authentication.

### XMPP Summit

Prior to FOSDEM, the XSF will also hold its [25th XMPP summit](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_25). This is where community members
gather to discuss protocol changes and the XMPP roadmap. We'll be reporting live from the event, and we'll post a review here on the blog after FOSDEM.
