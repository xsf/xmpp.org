While the XSF may not be mentoring a project in this years [Google's Summer of Code 2014](http://code.google.com/soc/) -  we sure can celebrate and shout about the fact that some of the projects include XMPP as part of their project ideas!

The [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/Development/GSoC) project has several projects relating to WebRTC, XMPP and the Jitsi Videobridge.

XMPP/Jingle/WebRTC also plays a role in Mozilla's project ideas for [InstantBird](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode14#Instantbird).

To name just a few...

We are really looking forward to seeing many of these exciting projects get implemented by students around the world!

Good luck!
