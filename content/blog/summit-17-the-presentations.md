A slightly tardy share, but we have the presentations from Summit 17 in Brussels starting to trickle in! As more come in, this post will get longer (and hopefully have a more permanent home on the new site) but here we go:

**XMPP Research**

With their active blog [xmppresearch.org](http://xmppresearch.org/), researchers from RWTH Aachen University and TU Dresden are contributing to an ongoing collection of academic works around XMPP, including a high-quality bibliography, demos and reviews. Domink Renzel presented their work and their goals to the Summit members.

**Blogging via XMPP**

Sergey Dobrov walked us through federated blogging and a combination of XMPP & PubSub/PEP. The presentation includes a call-out for help, and hwo you can get involved.

We would love to showcase more of the presentations, so if you have anything from the Summit you would like to share, please get in touch!
