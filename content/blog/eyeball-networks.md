We're happy to announce that Eyeball Networks are the latest organisation to become an XSF Sponsor.

Eyeball Networks pioneered the STUN/TURN/ICE device-to-device connection technologies adopted by communications standards including SIP, XMPP, IMS, PacketCable, IBM Sametime, Microsoft Lync, and now WebRTC. You can read more about them [here](https://xmpp.org/sponsor/our-sponsors/eyeball-networks/).

Sponsors are vital to the ability of the XSF to continue to fulfil its [mission](https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/xsf-mission/) to build an open, secure, feature-rich, decentralized infrastructure for real-time communication and collaboration over the Internet.

Our sponsors help us with everything from infrastructure for the XMPP site to funding the regular XMPP Summits so please take the time to thanks Eyeball Networks by visiting their website, getting them involved in discussions and perhaps following them on your social network of choice (from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eyeball-networks "LinkedIn"), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EyeballNetworks "Facebook: Eyeball Networks"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eyeballnetworks "Twitter: Eyeball Networks") and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+EyeballNetworks/posts "Google+: Eyeball Networks")).
