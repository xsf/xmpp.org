The [XSF](http://xmpp.org "XSF") recently held the [XMPP Summit 13](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_13 "XMPP Summit 13") in Brussels this past week, specifically January 31 and February 1, 2013 -- and truth be told we are all exhausted and amazed at how much discussion and planning can happen in two days when you get a bunch of bright, smart folks in the same room.

We would like to thank again our sponsors, who really stood up and helped make the event a success:

-   [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com) for providing the space and meals for the two days
-   [Isode Ltd.](http://www.isode.com/)
-   [&Yet](http://andyet.net)
-   [AG Software](http://www.ag-software.de/)
-   [buddycloud](http://buddycloud.com/)
-   [Jitsi](http://jitsi.org)
-   [Surevine](http://www.surevine.com/)
-   [Tilanus](http://tilanus.com)

**Note**: found this while working on another post - apologies for the delay!
