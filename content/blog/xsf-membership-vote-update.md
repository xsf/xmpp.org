We still need folks who haven't voted to do so as Alexander has reported that our current voting tally does not fulfill the required quorum.

The proxy voting is ongoing and will continue until the close of business on December 14th. On December 15th we will have one of the few required "all hands" meetings to formally approve the voting results.

The voting is handled by the XSF's Membership Bot [memberbot@jabber.org](xmpp:memberbot@jabber.org) and you can review the current membership applications listed here:   [November 2010 Applications](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_November_2010)

The meeting particulars are:

    Date: 2010-12-15
    Time: 20:00 UTC
    Location: xsf@muc.xmpp.org

If you have any questions or problems voting, please contact Alexander Gnauck via email or IM.
