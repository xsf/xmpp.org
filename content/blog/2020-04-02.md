## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of April 2020.

We are always happy about contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and help us sustain this as a community effort. The drafting process for each newsletter [is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).
Furthermore, we started drafting each new version in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls) - feel free to add information by yourself.

## Articles

[Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), maintainer of libstrophe and contributor to profanity, wrote about using the [XML console in profanity](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/xml-console-in-profanity/) for debugging.

Jan Cie≈õla from MongooseIM wrote a blog post about how [they drive their project by the metrics](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/how-data-drives-mongooseim.html).

Can you believe it? Zoom uses XMPP for its chat - cool! [Vulnerability](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/zoom-user-enumeration.html) - not cool.

MattJ (Prosody developer) mentioned that, according to Debian popcon statistics, the Prosody installations [have doubled since march](https://mastodon.technology/@mattj/104053716175271438).

## Software releases

[Kaidan 0.5.0](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/04/06/kaidan-0.5.0/) - Bam! Check out their new onboarding!

Let's sum it up like this: Remove OTR + Rework conference and contact details + Show PDF previews + Add title for audio files = [Pix-Art Messenger 2.3.5](https://github.com/kriztan/Pix-Art-Messenger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Four letters for Windows 10 Users: [UWPX 0.25.0](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.25.0.0) is online with Windows10X support and a push server. So give it a try!

Monal continues the fight on the iOS front: included in the upcoming [beta](https://monal.im/blog/4-6-betas/) are support for geo-location messages, [TLS ALPN support](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/issues/206) and improvements on [OpenFire push notifications](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/issues/354) as well as many fixes with smack.

Wow - no late April joke - Conversations released version 2.8.0 adding [audio and video calls](https://twitter.com/iNPUTmice/status/1254662039592742913)! The German IT magazine heise.de [wrote an article about the new A/V-Feature](https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Conversations-Open-Source-Messenger-mit-Audio-und-Videoanruf-4711187.html).

### Servers

Guus der Kinderen, from the Ignite Realtime Foundation Board, wrote a short article on [how to setup a STUN and TURN service in Openfire for audio and video calls](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/preparing-openfire-for-audio-video-calls-with-conversations/87828). The improvements for push notifications on iOS (see the post above for Monal) found their way into the [Push Notification Openfire plugin 0.7.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/push-notification-openfire-plugin-0-7-0-released/87855).

### Clients and applications

The maintainer of libstrophe, [Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), and contributor to Profanity, created a tool named [xmppconsole](https://github.com/pasis/xmppconsole) which sends raw XMPP stanzas over an XMPP connection and displays the XMPP stream. Main purpose is to study XEPs and debug servers implementation.
The tool is under development. The final version will support both GTK UI and ncurses UI. In their blog, they also explained how to easier contribute commits to their repository, [read on](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/contributing-a-patch-via-github/).

Dino now features [Last Message Correction](https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/871ff33ac79f3d17b0260b8bfcd27780038edd6d) for all the typos you made and the regrets you have. And also [voice handling in moderated groups](https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/2631a9bdbaf9a40f329f05c55c6e2ea38efeb10c)
