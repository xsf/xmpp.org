The [XSF](https://xmpp.org/) has been invited to participate in Google's [Summer of Code 2011](http://code.google.com/soc/)! Great job by everyone in making our application something the Goog couldn't resist ;)

But now the real work begins! We need the help of XMPP project members in getting a list of summer project ideas together!

So, if you're an XMPP project and would like to participate in GSoC under the XSF's umbrella, please visit the [Summer of Code 2011](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2011) wiki page and start adding ideas of projects you would like to mentor.

If you're a user of XMPP projects, and have great ideas, please get in contact with the projects and get them excited and involved in the   process too.

A longer post will be coming after Kevin and myself get all of the paper work done.
