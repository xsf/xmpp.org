## XMPP Community Projects

A new community space for XMPP related projects and individuals has been created in the Fediverse! Join us on our new [Lemmy instance](https://community.xmpp.net/) and chat about all XMPP things! 

Are you looking for an XMPP provider that suits you? There is a [new website](https://providers.xmpp.net) based on the data of [XMPP Providers](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers). XMPP Providers has a curated list of providers and tools for filtering and creating badges for them. The machine-readable list of providers can be [integrated in XMPP clients](https://providers.xmpp.net/apps/) to simplify the registration. You can [help](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) by improving your website (as a provider), by automating the manual tasks (as a developer), by adding new providers to the list (as an interested contributor). Read the [first blogpost](https://providers.xmpp.net/blog/2022-04-25-start-of-xmpp-providers-website/)!

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

By the way, have you checked our nice [XMPP RFC page](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/)? :-)

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0462](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0462.html) (PubSub Type Filtering)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2022-02-09.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0463](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0463.html) (MUC Affiliations Versioning)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2022-02-16.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 1.6.0 of [XEP-0115](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html) (Entity Capabilities)
    -   Mention preimage attacks explicitly (ssw)

-   Version 1.4.0 of [XEP-0156](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html) (Discovering Alternative XMPP Connection Methods)
    -   Remove DNS `_xmppconnect` method due to security vulnerability. (tjb)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Stable (formerly known as Draft)

Info: The XSF has decided to rename 'Draft' to 'Stable'. [Read more about it here.](https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1100)

-   No XEPs advanced to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

-   No XEP deprecated this month.

### Obsoleted

-   [XEP-0008](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0008.html) (IQ-Based Avatars)
    -   Obsoleted due to two superseding specifications (egp)

-   [XEP-0038](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0038.html) (Icon Styles)
    -   Obsolete due to the omnipresence of Unicode emoji, as well as Bits of Binary stickers. (egp)

-   [XEP-0051](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0051.html) (Connection Transfer)
    -   Obsolete because this feature has been merged into XMPP core, see RFC6120 section 4.9.3.19, which describes the <see-other-host/> stream error. (egp)

-   [XEP-0138](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0138.html) (Stream Compression)
    -   Obsolete due to security vulnerability. (tjb)

-   [XEP-0229](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0229.html) (Stream Compression with LZW)
    -   Obsolete due to security vulnerability. (tjb)

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
