The XMPP Standards Foundation has helped support a number of open-source projects through Google's Summer of Code program over the years. Although the XSF is [not participating](http://blog.xmpp.org/index.php/2009/02/google-summer-of-code/) in the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) this year, a number of XMPP-related projects have been accepted by other mentoring organizations...

On the [JabberFr forums](http://forum.jabberfr.org/), "Misc" [posted the full list](http://forum.jabberfr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=7958):

    -   [Privacy Rewrite](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/pidgin/t124023373129),

At the XSF, we're tremendously excited to see so much implementation of cutting edge technologies in so many widespread projects. It's a testement to the innovative nature of the XMPP community, and we're looking forward to seeing - and using - the results.
