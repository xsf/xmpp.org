The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) will hold its 27th XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium next year again!
These are the two days preceding [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/).
The XSF invites everyone interested in development of the XMPP protocol to attend, and discuss all things XMPP in person and remote!

### The Summit

The XMPP Summit is a two day event for the people who write and implement [XMPP extensions (XEPs)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/).
The event is not a conference and besides small and short lightning talks there are no long presentations.
The participants, where everyone is welcome, are sitting at a round table to discuss and active participation is encouraged.
Similar to an _unconference_ at the beginning all participants can suggest topics and others can indicate via votes whether or not they are interested in that topic. 
Afterwards a rough order of topics is established that will be followed in moderation with the participants.

If you have ever followed a thread on the [standards mailing list](https://xmpp.org/community/mailing-lists/) or participated in a discussion on the [public XSF channel](https://xmpp.org/community/chat/) you should be familiar with this, now only in person.
The different topics are broken up by short breaks that are great for networking and getting to know other XMPP developers.
Still, if you cannot participate, we will also provide an online way of joining the discussion.

Agreeing on a common strategy or even establishing a rough priority for certain features in our decentral and interoperable technology and protocol can be hard.
In-person events do a lot in getting us on the same page and as an XMPP developer (e.g. client, server, gateway) we strongly encourage you to come to the summit.
(Info: To get the most out of the summit you should have a background in reading (and maybe even writing) XEPs). If you are simply an enthusiastic user or admin we regularly have booths at various conferences (FOSDEM, CLT, FrOSCon, …) that are a great opportunity to meet us, too.

If we gained your attention, we will then hopefully see you at the XMPP Summit 27. Read on!
