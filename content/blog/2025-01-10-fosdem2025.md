We're very excited to be back at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/) in person in 2025.
Once again, many members of the XSF and the XMPP community will be attending, and we hope to see you there!

### Realtime Lounge

As usual, we will host the *Realtime Lounge*, where you can come and meet community members, project developers, see demos and ask us questions.
We'll be in our traditional location - find us on the K building 2nd floor, [beside the elevator](https://fosdem.org/2025/stands/) (map below).
Come and say Hi!
Yes, we got stickers :-)

### Talks

There will be a presentation in the [Real Time Communications (RTC)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/rtc/) track:

- [Jérôme Poisson (Goffi)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/speaker/jerome_poisson_goffi/):
    - [A Universal and Stable API to Everything: XMPP](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5721-a-universal-and-stable-api-to-everything-xmpp/): "Nowadays, most services provide APIs with their own formats, and sometimes multiple versions, which may change over time. But there is a universal API, with an excellent track record of stability and backward compatibility: XMPP!.
    In this talk, I'll show how XMPP can be more than just an Instant Messaging protocol, and how it can be an extremely powerful tool to access almost anything, from third-party networks (IM, microblogging, etc.) to file sharing, automation (IoT), and more. ".
    The presentation will take place on Saturday, February 1st 2025, on the [Real Time Communications (RTC)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/rtc/) track, room [K.3.601](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/k3601/), starting at 18:25 and ending at 18:40 hs.

### XMPP Summit 27

Prior to FOSDEM, the XSF will also hold its [27th XMPP summit](https://xmpp.org/2024/11/xmpp-summit-27/).
This is where community members gather to discuss protocol changes and exchange within the developer community.
We'll be reporting live from the event and also from [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/).
