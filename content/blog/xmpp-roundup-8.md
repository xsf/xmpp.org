**Specifications**

The XMPP Standards Foundation has been busy finalizing a number of items on its [roadmap](/about/xsf/roadmap). Here is a brief summary:

The core specifications underlying the XMPP [Jingle technology](https://xmpp.org/tech/jingle.shtml) are very close to being done, and are currently in "Last Call" within the XSF's standards process. The specifications in question are [Jingle](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html), [Jingle RTP Sessions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html), [Jingle ICE-UDP Transport Method](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0176.html), and [Jingle Raw UDP Transport Method](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0177.html). Once these specifications advance to Draft, expect to see more Jingle implementations as well as further progress on other Jingle-related technologies (e.g., [file transfer](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0234.html)).

Another area of focus right now is improved reliability and traffic optimization for mobile applications of XMPP. There are two technologies being developed to address these issues: [stream management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) (which provides acks and reliable delivery of XMPP stanzas) and [roster versioning](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0237.html) (which removes the need to download the complete XMPP roster each time a client logs in). The XMPP developer community appears to have consensus on these improvements, so look for them to be implemented and deployed in the relatively near future.

In addition, members of the XMPP developer community held a successful "Birds of a Feather" session at the most recent meeting of the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://www.ietf.org/) as a means of jump-starting work to finalize the improvements to the XMPP RFCs, which define the very core of XMPP. If an XMPP Working Group is approved, it will also work on some security enhancements to XMPP as well as adjustments to server-to-server communication for increased scalability. We will be reporting on this work more fully in the coming months.

**Conclusion**

2009 continues to be a very busy year for XMPP development, implementation, and deployment. So busy that it is difficult to find people who can report on everything that is happening! However, we will endeavor to publish "XMPP Roundup \#9" before too much more time goes by.
