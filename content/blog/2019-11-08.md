Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of October 2019.

This is a community effort, and [the process is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter): please help us spread the word, share this newsletter.

## Articles

QuickBlox has written a blog post about [the use of XMPP in 2019](https://quickblox.com/blog/why-quickblox-choose-xmpp-protocol/).

Ben Kwiecien rediscovered XMPP after years and [compared ejabberd and Prosody](https://kwiecien.us/archives/2019/10/16/ejabberd_vs__prosody/index.html) in setting up a mobile friendly server.

Neetesh Mehrotra wrote about XMPP as a [Communication Protocol for the IoT](https://opensourceforu.com/2019/10/xmpp-a-communication-protocol-for-the-iot/), comparing it to MQTT and HTTP.
