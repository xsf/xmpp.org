As the XMPP Roundup posts are growing longer each time we send one out, we've decided to split them into smaller posts, each covering a different aspect of XMPP news:

-   Articles, talks and events
-   Software
-   Services
-   Specifications

So, here is the first of the "Articles, talks and events" posts.

*XMPP Roundup translations*

The previous XMPP Roundup 12 has been translated into [spanish](http://www.jabberes.org/node/1139 "http://www.jabberes.org/node/1139") thanks to naw and [french](http://news.jabberfr.org/?p=31 "http://news.jabberfr.org/?p=31") thanks to Misc and Nÿco. If you can translate the Roundups into other languages, please do so.

*GAEJ + XMPP and rolling your own Agent*

Romin Irani, also author of the bloodbanklocator covered on the XMPP Roundup, has written an article on how to write an XMPP agent for GAEJ (Goole App Engine Java): "[Episode 2 : GAEJ + XMPP and rolling your own Agent](http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/gaej-xmpp-and-rolling-your-own-agent/ "http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/gaej-xmpp-and-rolling-your-own-agent/")" and "[Episode 2 : Update : Communicating to another XMPP Account via your Bot](http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/episode-2-update-communicating-to-another-xmpp-account-via-your-bot/ "http://gaejexperiments.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/episode-2-update-communicating-to-another-xmpp-account-via-your-bot/")".
