A new sprint is being organised within the XMPP Community: **The Elbe-Sprint Hamburg**!

We will have several days of good and fruitful exchange and projects. Many thanks to the [Chaos Computer Club Hansestadt Hamburg (CCCHH)](https://www.hamburg.ccc.de/) for offering their space!

The sprint will be all around XMPP and offer the opportunity to meet, present, discuss, but also work on your projects and implementations.
Of course, the event is open to general newcomers, XMPP users and any interested party. If you're planning to attend, [signing up](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Sprints/2023-06_Elbe-Sprint_Hamburg) would help us organise things.
