The XMPP Standards Foundation will elect the 2019-2020 XSF Board and Council soon. Each year the members of the XSF choose new people to provide technical leadership on the [XMPP Council](https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation.html#council) and business leadership on the [XSF Board of Directors](https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation.html#board).

For the upcoming election, the XSF is looking for candidates for both roles! Candidates for the XMPP Council are searched for within the ranks of the XSF Members, while the role of Director of the XSF Board is open to anyone. Both roles typically require only a few hours a week over the one-year term, and are a great way to get involved in the XMPP community.

If you're interested in volunteering or know someone else who might be, visit the [wiki page](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2019), drop by in the [XSF chatroom](xmpp:xsf@muc.xmpp.org?join) ([web client](https://xmpp.org/chat?xsf)) or ask one of the current [Board](https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation.html#board) or [Council](https://xmpp.org/about/xmpp-standards-foundation.html#council) members for insights.

Proxy voting is scheduled to start on November 4th, and we will hold our annual meeting to elect the Board and Council on November 21st.
