Earlier today, the XSF advanced [XEP-0262](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0262.html) from Experimental to Draft in our standards process. This specification defines how to use [ZRTP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6189) with [Jingle](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html) for end-to-end encryption of audio and video sessions, thus supplementing the existing SRTP method defined in [XEP-0167](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html).

Special thanks to the [Jitsi](http://jitsi.org/) team for providing implementation feedback.
