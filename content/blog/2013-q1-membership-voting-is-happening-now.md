Alex has started the membership voting process (big shout-out and thanks to Lance for getting the bot updated!) and would love it if all the current members chat with the [memberbot](xmpp:memberbot@xmpp.org) and vote on the [2013 Q1 membership applications](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_Q1_2013).
Proxy voting will continue until the close of business on May 1st with the meeting to follow on May 2nd.
