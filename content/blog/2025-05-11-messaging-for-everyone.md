Recently, the XMPP Standards Foundation has published an extended and detailed technical [open letter to Meta](https://xmpp.org/announcements/open-letter-meta-dma/).
Though, many technical or special terms and expression may struggle many readers.
We believe that everyone should be able to understand and communicate the letter.
Therefore, we wrote a simplified summary of the letter.

Right now, most messaging apps (like WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, and others) are closed off from each other.
If you want to chat with all your friends, you have to join every app they use - or convince them to use the same app as you.
This puts a lot of power in the hands of a few big companies, making it hard for new or smaller services to compete and for users to have real choice.

## The Solution: Interoperability between chat apps

The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) says that big messaging platforms must let users communicate across different chat apps.
This is called interoperability.
It is like how you can call anyone on the phone, no matter which network they use.

## The Open Standard: XMPP

For over 25 years, the [XMPP protocol](https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/) has made this kind of open messaging possible and is used in many products.
XMPP is:
* Open: Anyone can use it or build on it and no secrets are involved in the technology development.
* Federated: Like email, you can choose your provider, but still talk to anyone, anywhere.
* Proven: Big names like Google, Facebook, and WhatsApp have used XMPP in the past.

## What’s Wrong with Meta’s Proposal?

Meta (the company behind WhatsApp and Messenger) has suggested a way to connect with other apps, but their plan:
* Keeps control in Meta’s hands by requiring secret agreements (NDAs).
* Limits what others can do by using private interfaces (APIs) instead of open standards.
* Puts your privacy at risk by forcing all messages through Meta’s systems, even if you’re not a Meta user.
* Makes it hard for new players to join, because each new connection needs a custom solution.

This is not real interoperability - it’s just another way for Meta to stay in charge.

## The Power of Federation

Federation means different services can connect and talk to each other, while still being independent.
Think of it like email: you can have Gmail, Outlook, or any other address, but you can email anyone.
This keeps things open, competitive, and gives you real choice.

## Why Now?

If we don’t act, we risk a future where a few companies control all our digital conversations.
But with open standards like XMPP, we can build a world where:
* You choose your messaging app freely which can connect to all other messengers that support it.
* You keep control of your data and privacy - which is a strength to have!
* Innovation thrives thorugh open standards, and so also small companies can compete.

## Join the Movement

We believe in an open, federated future for messaging.
Let’s not settle for half-measures.
Let’s demand true interoperability - so everyone can connect and communicate in a sovereign way.

**Choose open technology. Choose interoperability. Choose XMPP.**
