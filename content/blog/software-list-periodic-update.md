The XSF provides a [public list of XMPP implementations][0] on its
website. For this list to be useful, it should contain up-to-date
information about up-to-date software.
To achieve this, the XSF Board has decided that all implementations have
to reapply once per year, to ensure that they are still actively
maintained and that the listed info is accurate. This is a purely formal
process, though we encourage implementors to follow the current compliance
suites.

If you have an entry in one of the lists, please create a pull request
as desribed in the [README][1] before the 1st of May 2017. There is an
[example commit][2] that can be used as a reference. Software that is not updated until
that date will be automatically removed from the listing. Alternatively, you
can ask in the [jdev MUC][3] for a manual update of your listing.

Please also ensure that you repeat this step in the following years.
