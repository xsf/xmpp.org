We are happy to announce that the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is applying as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) organization.

Open source projects are now able to add their XMPP-related project ideas to [the XMPP GSoC Project Ideas wiki page](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/GSoC/2019/Project_Ideas)

Interested parties are also invited to join us at [gsoc@muc.xmpp.org](xmpp:gsoc@muc.xmpp.org?join). Feel free to stop by, ask questions and to discuss your project idea. We welcome everyone, not only those new to GSoC and consider participating.

Google will publish the list of accepted mentoring organizations on 2019-02-26 12:00 UTC. We hope to continue the long tradition of the XSF participating in GSoC, so keep your fingers crossed.

You can find more about the GSoC under [https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).
