## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

xmpp.org features [a page about XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/) as well.

### Proposed
The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to 
accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0469](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0469.html) (Bookmark Pinning)
  - This document defines an XMPP protocol extension to allow users to pin PEP Native Bookmarks.
- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0470](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0470.html) (Pubsub Attachments)
  - This specification provides a way to attach elements to a pubsub item.
  
### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it 
will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0447](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0447.html) (Stateless file sharing)
  - Add disposition attribute to signal when inlining is desired. (lmw)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0470](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0470.html) (Pubsub Attachments)
  - Update reactions to be similar to  Message Reactions (XEP-0444)
  - Namespace bump (jp)
- Version 1.1 of [XEP-0231](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0231.html) (Bits of Binary)
  - Mention where to get textual names of hash functions. (ssw)
- Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0440](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0440.html) (SASL Channel-Binding Type Capability)
  - Make implementation of tls-server-end-point a MUST for servers. (tm)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0446](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0446.html) (File metadata element)
  - Use height/width instead of dimensions (lmw)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0448](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0448.html) (Encryption for stateless file sharing)
  - Replace the ProtoXEP reference with a reference to the published XEP.
  - Add urn:xmpp:ciphers:aes-256-cbc-pkcs7:0 (same as used in XEP-0384) (lmw)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0215](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0215.html) (External Service Discovery)
  - Accept as Stable as per Council Vote from 2022-08-03. (XEP Editor (jsc)) 
  
### Deprecated

- No XEP deprecated this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
