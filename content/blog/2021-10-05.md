## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

-   No new XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.8.0 of [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) (OMEMO Encryption)
    -   Update to [XEP-0420](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0420.html) version 0.4.0 and adjust namespace
    -   Replace SCE's old 'content' element by its new 'envelope' element
    -   Replace SCE's old 'payload' element by its new 'content' element
    -   Update SCE's namespace to 'urn:xmpp:sce:1'
    -   Update namespace to 'urn:xmpp:omemo:2' (melvo)

-   Version 0.14.0 of [XEP-0280](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html) (Message Carbons)
    -   Incorporate LC feedback: Remove requirement to remove "private" elements (and add interop note), completely reword mobile considerations to fit modern reality. (gl)

-   Version 1.1 of [XEP-0227](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0227.html) (Portable Import/Export Format for XMPP-IM Servers)
    -   Discourage use of 'password', provide a way to include SCRAM credentials, PEP nodes and message archives. (mw)

-   Version 1.22.0 of [XEP-0060](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) (Publish-Subscribe)
    -   Remove exception for last item when purging a node: all items must be removed. (jp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   [XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html) XMPP Compliance Suites 2022

### Stable (formely known as Draft)

Info: The XSF has decided to rename 'Draft' to 'Stable'. [Read more about it here.](https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1100)

-   No Stable this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. We really need more support!

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
And even if you can only spend a few minutes of support, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
