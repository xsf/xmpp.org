Although the XMPP Standards Foundation runs its own [standards process](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html) and publishes a dedicated [specification series](https://xmpp.org/extensions/) for XMPP extensions, we continue to work within the [Internet Engineering Task Force](http://www.ietf.org/) on relevant specifications, which we [mirror](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/) at xmpp.org for convenient access.

Lately we have updated several of the RFCs and Internet-Drafts we are working on within the IETF:

-   [draft-saintandre-rfc4622bis](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc4622bis-00.html)
    - this document corrects several errors in [RFC 4622](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4622), which defines the
    xmpp: URI scheme (a handy diff from RFC 4622 is [here](http://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url1=http%3A%2F%2Ftools.ietf.org%2Frfc%2Frfc4622.txt&url2=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xmpp.org%2Finternet-drafts%2Fdraft-saintandre-rfc4622bis-00.txt&difftype=--hwdiff))
-   [draft-saintandre-jabberid](http: www.xmpp.org internet-drafts draft-saintandre-jabberid-05.html)
    - this document defines the [Jabber-ID email header](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/Jabber_Email_Header), which enables you to specify your XMPP address in the email messages you send
-   [draft-saintandre-xmpp-simple](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-xmpp-simple-09.html)
    - this document, which describes interworking between XMPP and SIMPLE for basic IM and presence, shows our continued commitment to open communication (an [informal last call](http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/simple/current/msg07146.html) is in progress on the discussion list of the IETF's [SIMPLE WG](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/simple-charter.html))
-   [draft-ietf-sieve-notify-xmpp](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sieve-notify-xmpp-04.html)
    - this document, an official work item of the IETF's [Sieve WG](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/sieve-charter.html), defines how to generate XMPP notifications for receipt of new email (and more) using the [Sieve](http://www.fastmail.fm/docs/sieve/index.html) email filtering language

And look for some relatively slight modifications to [rfc3920bis](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3920bis-01.html) and [rfc3921bis](https://xmpp.org/internet-drafts/draft-saintandre-rfc3921bis-01.html) soon.
