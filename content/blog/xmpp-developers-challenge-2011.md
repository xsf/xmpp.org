With the 10th XMPP Summit starting at the end of the week, it's time to announce the Developer's Challenge! Similar to last year's one, this year we're again targeting mobile devices. [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com) has been generous and given us a Nokia N8 to give away, as well as demo phones for the 4 days, equipped with the full power of the Internet thanks to [MobileVikings](http://www.mobilevikings.com).

We've set up a Wiki page with all the information on the Dev Challenge [here](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/XMPP_Summit_10_Dev_Challenge). Developers are allowed to start today with the development of the applications!
