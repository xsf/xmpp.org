Alex has started the membership voting process for Q2 2013 applications and would love it if all the current members chat with the [memberbot](xmpp:memberbot@xmpp.org) and vote on the [2013 Q2 membership applications](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_Q2_2013).

Proxy voting will continue until the close of business on August 28th with the meeting to follow on August 29th.
