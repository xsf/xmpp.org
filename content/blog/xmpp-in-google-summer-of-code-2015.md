We've just had the great news that Google have again accepted the XSF to mentor XMPP-related projects in the Google Summer of Code this year. GSoC is a programme whereby Google pays students a stipend to work on open source projects for the summer, and when we're able to participate in this it's a highlight of the year for us. If you are, or know any, talented students with an interest in realtime communication systems we've got a selection of interesting projects at [http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer\_of\_Code\_2015](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2015).

Our page on the GSoC site is at [https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/xmpp](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/xmpp), and for more information on GSoC in general please see the Google site at [https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015).

Student applications open on March 16th but that's no reason to delay - come and chat with us about our possible projects with the contact venues listed on [http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer\_of\_Code\_2015](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2015).

We've got the ideas, we've got the mentors, all we need are a few students to turn this into a great summer for XMPP.
