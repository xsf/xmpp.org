We're very excited to be back at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/) in person in 2024.
Once again, many members of the XSF and the XMPP community will be attending, and we hope to see you there!

### Realtime Lounge

As usual, we will host the *Realtime Lounge*, where you can come and meet community members, project developers, see demos and ask us questions.
We'll be in our traditional location - find us on the K building 2nd floor, [beside the elevator](https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/) (map below).
Come and say Hi!
Yes, we got stickers :-)

### Talks

There are talks in the [Real Time Communications devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/real-time-communications/) that relate to XMPP.
These are so far:

- [Bridging Open Protocols: XMPP and ActivityPub Gateway via Libervia](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2857-bridging-open-protocols-xmpp-and-activitypub-gateway-via-libervia/). In this session, we'll explore the architecture of this gateway, detailing how it facilitates communication between XMPP and ActivityPub. We'll delve into the intricacies of protocol mapping and discuss how Libervia integrates features such as microblogging, reactions, likes/favorites, mentions, and calendar events across these platforms.


Talk in [Python devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/python-devroom/):

- [How I've Built a Web Frontend for a Federated Communication Tool with Brython](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2337-how-i-ve-built-a-web-frontend-for-a-federated-communication-tool-with-brython/): This talk discusses the application of [Brython](https://www.brython.info), a Python implementation in JavaScript, in developing the web frontend for [Libervia](https://libervia.org), a multi-frontend XMPP client.

### XMPP Summit 26

Prior to FOSDEM, the XSF will also hold its [26th XMPP summit](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_26).
This is where community members gather to discuss protocol changes and exchange within the developer community.
We'll be reporting live from the event and also from FOSDEM.
