[FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org/2008/) is coming up soon (Brussels, February 23-24) and the XSF will once again hold a [devcon](https://xmpp.org/devcon/devcon4.shtml) (on February 24 and 25).

The [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org/xsf/) would like to encourage XMPP technologists from Europe and beyond to participate, especially in the devcon. In its meeting earlier this week, the XSF Board of Directors authorized a new policy: the Foundation will pay the hotel costs of any XSF member who participates in the devcon. The XSF may ask that you share a room with another XSF member, but we will pay for up to four nights' stay at the Atlas hotel in the center of Brussels (where we will be staying and meeting).

To take advantage of this offer, you must participate in the devcon and you must be an XSF member. If you are not yet an XSF member or you need to renew your membership, you can do so [here](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/Membership_Applications_January_2008) until January 20.

Because we need to tell the hotel how many rooms we need, please contact XSF Executive Director Peter Saint-Andre or XSF Chair Alexander Gnauck by Friday, January 18 if you would like to take advantage of this offer.

See you in Brussels!
