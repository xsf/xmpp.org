## Software news
### Clients and applications

[BeagleIM 5.3.2, 5.3.3 and SiskinIM 7.3.1, 7.3.2](https://tigase.org/blog/beagleim-5.3.2-and-siskinim-7.3.1-released/) have been released with an option to block whole domains and a number of bugfixes. And brand new logos and icons.

[Conversation 2.11.0 to 2.12.1 have been released](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/src/branch/master/CHANGELOG.md)! They implement Extensible SASL Profile, Bind 2.0 + Channel Binding and Fast for faster reconnects. Furthermore the ability to switch from audio call to video call, to delete your own avatar and a notification for missed calls has been added. Since version 2.12.0 it now also integrates an [UnifiedPush Distributor](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/) to facilitate push messages to other UnifiedPush enabled apps like Tusky and Fedilab. Users can use the developer provided UP server or ask their server admins to host an UP server as [an universal XMPP transport component](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/up) or load the [new Prosody module](https://modules.prosody.im/mod_unified_push). As announced in the [November 2022 newsletter](https://xmpp.org/2022/12/the-xmpp-newsletter-november-2022/) version 3.0 got funded, hence development has started already, you can keep an eye on its pace in the [new `c3` code branch](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/commits/branch/c3).

For Gajim 1.6, developers ported Gajim’s and python-nbxmpp’s underlying HTTP library to libsoup3. Also, audio previews now look nicer and allow for more control (playback speed, jumping). Emoji rendering on MacOS has been repaired and many fixes have been implemented under the hood.

Libervia has been granted a [NLnet NGI Assure Fund for implementation of Audio/Video Calls](https://nlnet.nl/project/Libervia-AV/).

[Moxxy 0.4.0](https://codeberg.org/moxxy/moxxy/releases/tag/v0.4.0) and [0.4.1](https://codeberg.org/moxxy/moxxy/releases/tag/v0.4.1) have been released. These two releases bring stickers, reactions, voice message recording and various improvements and fixes to the UI and XMPP code.

### Servers

[ejabberd 23.01 has been released](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-23-01/) Almost three months after the previous release, ejabberd 23.01 includes many bug fixes, several improvements and some new features. A new module, mod_mqtt_bridge, can be used to replicate changes to MQTT topics between local and remote servers. Supported XEPs are now automatically gathered from source code documentation in order to provide a DOAP file for further processing on [xmpp.org/servers/ejabberd](https://xmpp.org/software/servers/ejabberd/).

[Prosody 0.12.2 has been released](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.12.2-released/) and [Prosody 0.11.14 released](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.11.14-released/), which contains allowance U+7F when constructing stanzas, bug fixes and improvements.

[Tigase XMPP Server 8.3 has been released](https://tigase.org/blog/tigase-xmpp-server-8.3.0/) -  it includes Tigase MEET - Tigase's take at SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) group video-calls, support for XEP-0440 SASL Channel Binding Type Capability as well as initial, preview support for SASL2 and Bind2 and lots of usual fixes.

### Libraries & Tools

[omemo_dart](https://github.com/PapaTutuWawa/omemo_dart) is a Dart library to help developers of Dart/Flutter XMPP clients to implement OMEMO in its newest version - currently 0.8.3. It has been released in version 0.4.2.

[python-nbxmpp 4.0.0 to 4.1.0 have been released](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/blob/master/ChangeLog). These versions bring support for Message Reactions (XEP-0444) and port the library to libsoup3.

A new tool for server operators and developers has arrived: [nbxmpp-client](https://pypi.org/project/nbxmpp-client/) lets you check and test various XMPP connection methods (and proxy configurations) while having an eye on the protocol's XML stream. Version 2.0.0 has just been released and comes with a fresh design (Gtk4+libadwaita).

[Slidge 0.1.0 RC1 has been released](https://www.nicoco.fr/blog/2023/01/08/slidge-rc1/). Slidge is a collection of XMPP gateway components that lets you use your favorite XMPP client(s) to chat with other, non-XMPP and/or non-federated chat networks (i.e. WhatsApp, Facebook, Mattermost, Signal, Skype, Steam, Telegram).

Daniel Gultsch's [compliance.conversations.im](https://compliance.conversations.im/) [will be discontinued](https://gultsch.social/@daniel/109653873511471850). This online compliance checker allowed server administrators and users to identify the XEPs/features supported by a provider, and it also allowed to check XEP support over time. This service helped users to check whether they are creating a future-proof account with a provider. Due to difficulties in maintaining the software, the service will be shut down in the near future.

[QXmpp 1.5](https://github.com/qxmpp-project/qxmpp/releases/tag/v1.5.0) has been released! The Qt-/C++-based XMPP library supports OMEMO 2, Stanza Content Encryption and Automatic Trust Management now. Much more data than with the old OMEMO versions can be end-to-end encrypted. For example, files including thumbnails are shared encrypted via Stateless File Sharing. Furthermore, Message Reactions is supported and QXmpp's PubSub implementation is almost feature-complete.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

xmpp.org features [a page about XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/) as well.

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to 
accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [XMPP Compliance Suites 2023](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/cs-2023.html)
  - This document defines XMPP application categories for different use cases (Core, Web, IM, and Mobile), and specifies the required XEPs that client and server software needs to implement for compliance with the use cases.
- [Stream Limits Advertisement](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/xep-sla.html)
  - This specification defines a way for an XMPP entity to announce the limits it will enforce for data received on a stream.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it 
will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- No XEP moved to stable this month.
  
### Deprecated

- No XEP deprecated this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
