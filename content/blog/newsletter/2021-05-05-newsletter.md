Libervia (formerly Salut à Toi) has been selected for a grant by NLNet/NGI0 Discovery Fund (with financial support from European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme) for an [gateway between XMPP and ActivityPub doubled with Pubsub end-to-end encryption project](https://www.goffi.org/b/activitypub-gateway-and-pubsub-e2ee-QGqK). The gateway will join two major open and decentralised protocols. In practice it will be a XMPP server component (usable with any server), and implement the ActivityPub server to server protocol (or "Federation Protocol"). On XMPP side, it will be mostly a Pubsub service (with some extra, like private messages converted to XMPP message stanza).

[Vaxbot continues to grow](https://monal.im/blog/vaxbot-continues-to-grow/): VaxBot is a free service that helps you find vaccine appointments in your state or country if available. During the last weeks, [Vaxbot](https://vaccine.monal.im) continued to grow. The service just hit 8 million messages sent and it sends around 800,000 messages a day. XMPP and Vaxbot have been on TV news in Las Vegas and South Carolina, the radio in Washington as well newspapers all over the country. 

Refering the Vaxbot news: Georg Lukas, who runs the server behind it, wrote an article regarding the increased subscriptions and how the services have to adapt the infrastructure to [keep up with this new "VaxBot performance challenge"](https://yaxim.org/blog/2021/04/09/vaxbot-performance-challenge/).

## Software news

### Clients and applications

[Conversation 2.9.11 and 2.9.12 have been released](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), fixing 'No Connectivity' issues on Android 7.1 and adding support for roster pre-authentication.

[Gajim 1.3.2 has been released](https://gajim.org/post/2021-04-24-gajim-1.3.2-released/): This release brings back translations for Windows users. It also adds some small fixes and improvements.

[Monal 5 Beta 4 has been released](https://monal.im/blog/monal-5-beta-4/) with lots of updates.

Since there appeared a lot of [sendxmpp](https://sendxmpp.hostname.sk/) alternatives over the last years there is now an work-inprogress overview in the [XSF wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/User:MDosch/Sendxmpp_incarnations).

[UWPX is replacing the SQLite-net DB backend with a new Entity Framework Core DB](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.31.0.0). This comes with a fix and update of the OMEMO implementation to the latest version of the draft (OMEMO 0.7.0 (2020-09-05)). This version is incompatible with all other previous versions of OMEMO and UWPX allows you now to only exchange OMEMO encrypted messages with contacts that support at least OMEMO 0.7.0 (2020-09-05) draft. Now UWPX can act as a client with a proper one to one OMEMO implementation!

[Spark 3.0.0 Beta](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/spark-3-0-0-beta-released/90084) has been released bringing fixes as usual. Pade Meetings is now integrated (it enables audio and video chat) and all these over a complete UI refresh.

## Servers

[ejabberd 21.04 has been released](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-21-04/): The new ejabberd 21.04 release includes many bugfixes and a few improvements. This release includes minor improvements to fully support 
Erlang/OTP 24 and Rebar3. At the same time, it maintains support back to the old Erlang/OTP 19.3 and Rebar2.

[Openfire 4.6.3 has been released](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-6-3-is-released/90062): This release contains a number of bug fixes and denotes the desire to provide stable 4.6.x series releases while development work continues on a 4.7.0 release.

## Libraries

[slixmpp 1.7.1](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp/-/releases/slix-1.7.1) has been released, which is a bugfix release for a rarely used code path tied to OMEMO.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs have been proposed this month.

### New

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0457](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0457.html) (Message Fancying)
    -   This specification defines a Unicode-formatted fancy text syntax for use in instant messages.
    -   Initial published version. (XEP Editor (jsc))

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.4.0 of [XEP-0420](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0420.html) (Stanza Content Encryption)

    -   Add new section, use more precise sentences, apply consistent formatting:
    -   Add new section for Trust Message URIs
    -   Use 'that' instead of 'which' for restrictive clauses
    -   Apply consistent formatting for paragraphs and revision history
    -   Update to XEP-0420 version 0.4.0 and adapt namespace to shortname
    -   Replace SCE's old 'content' element by its new 'envelope' element
    -   Replace SCE's old 'payload' element by its new 'content' element
    -   Update SCE's namespace to 'urn:xmpp:sce:1'
    -   Change namespace to 'urn:xmpp:tm:0' (melvo)

-   Versions 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 of [XEP-0450](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0450.html) (Automatic Trust Management (ATM)
    -   Add usage of Trust Message URIs, use more precise sentences, apply consistent formatting
    -   Add usage of Trust Message URIs for initial authentications
    -   Use 'that' instead of 'which' for restrictive clauses

    -   Update TM's namespace to 'urn:xmpp:tm:0'
    -   Update namespace to 'urn:xmpp:atm:1' (melvo)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   [XEP-0280](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html) Message Carbons
-   [XEP-0313](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) Message Archive Management

### Draft

-   No Drafts this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
And even if you can only spend a few minutes of support, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
