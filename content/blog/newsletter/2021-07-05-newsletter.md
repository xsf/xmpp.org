## Software news

### Clients and applications

Blabber.IM XMPP service has been discontinued and has shut down its server. On June 25, the [blabber.im website](https://blabber.im/) reported that they were discontinuing support for their XMPP server due to personal reasons.

In this respect, [MattJ announced](https://mastodon.technology/@mattj/106517206134989817) created a tool for users to migrate their roster and vcards but also subscriptions to another XMPP account. [Find the XMPP account exporter here](https://migrate.modernxmpp.org/).

[Gajim Development News](https://gajim.org/post/2021-06-27-development-news-june/): This month brought some fixes for themes and spell checking. Development on the new Gajim version made a big step forward: file previews are working again and more important they're now a core integrated feature, they look even better while also being privacy respecting for those anonymous chats.

Monal 5.0 [has been released](https://monal.im/blog/monal-with-group-chat-and-voice-messages/), featuring support for group chats (not yet OMEMO encrypted, will come next) and sending voice messages and videos, but also a lot of internal code refactoring and bug fixes.

## Libraries

Have you heard about [qxbridge a Qt XMPP Bridge for Telegram](https://invent.kde.org/lnj/qxbridge/) based on QXmpp.

There is a new [ProtoXEP for for pre-auth key generation](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/preauth-ibr.html), which would allow for fancy new uses, such as [XMPP Self Provisioning with Mastodon](https://github.com/mellium/fediverse-xmpp-onboarding)


## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   [Pre-auth Registration Key Generation and Validation](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/preauth-ibr.html)
    -   This specification updates XEP-0401 and XEP-0445 by specifying a shared format for the pre-authenticated registration token.

-   [Moved 2.0](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/moved2.html)
    -   This specification details a way for a user to notify their contacts about an account move.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2022)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2021-05-26.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0458](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0458.html) (Community Code of Conduct)
    -   Accept as Experimental after unanimous approval by Board of the ProtoXEP draft for discussion within the community.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEP deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0458](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0458.html) (Community Code of Conduct)
    -   Integrate various comments from various sources (dwd)

-   Version 0.3 of [XEP-0377](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0377.html) (Spam Reporting)
    -   Rework based on list feedback. (ssw)

-   Version 0.11 of [XEP-0292](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0292.html) (vCard4 Over XMPP)
    -   Recommend use of contact bare JIDs for item IDs (ka)

-   Version 1.20.0 of [XEP-0060](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) (Publish-Subscribe)
    -   Add integer-or-max datatype to use with Data Forms Validation. (pep)

### Obsoleted

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0423](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0423.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2020)
    -   Update to Draft as per council vote on 2019/11/07
    -   Successors are XMPP Compliance Suites 2021 ([XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html)) and 2022 ([XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html))

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Draft

-   No Draft this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. We really need more support!

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
And even if you can only spend a few minutes of support, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
