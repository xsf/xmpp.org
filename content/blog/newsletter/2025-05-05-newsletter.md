## XMPP Software News

### XMPP Clients and Applications

- [Cheogram](https://cheogram.com/) has released version [2.17.10-1](https://git.sr.ht/~singpolyma/cheogram-android/refs/2.17.10-1) for Android. This version introduces an initial implementation of Spaces ([XEP-503](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0503.html)), among other improvements, bugfixes and more!
- [Conversations](https://conversations.im/) has released versions [2.18.0](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/releases/tag/2.18.0), [2.18.1](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/releases/tag/2.18.1) and [2.18.2](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations/releases/tag/2.18.2) for Android. Notable changes include the ability to pick a custom backup location, a prominent backup restore option for [Quicksy](https://quicksy.im/), and improved support for more kinds of URIs. The latter includes `tel` phone numbers, `mailto` email addresses, and more interestingly the `web+ap` scheme for ActivityPub proposed by [Fedi Links](https://fedilinks.org/).
- [Dino](https://dino.im/) has released version [0.5](https://github.com/dino/dino/releases/tag/v0.5.0) featuring OMEMO encryption by default, improved file transfers, image preview and other file details before downloading, and two completely reworked dialogs. See the release [blog post](https://dino.im/blog/2025/04/dino-0.5-release/) for all the details.
  - At the same time, Dino has also [received funding](https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20250422-announcement-grants-CommonsFund.html) from [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) to begin development on a slew of new features. This includes message moderation in group chats, local message deletion, modern connection handling with FAST and SASL2, more formatting options with Message Markup, and more! [Visit the project page](https://nlnet.nl/project/Dino-UX/) for all the details.
- [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) has released versions [2.1.0](https://gajim.org/post/2025-04-08-gajim-2.1.0-released/) and [2.1.1](https://gajim.org/post/2025-04-17-gajim-2.1.1-released/) with a new 'Activity feed' page, layout improvements for its 'Start Chat' dialog and support for 'Message Display Synchronisation' ([XEP-0490](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0490.html)) across group chats among other improvements and bugfixes. Head over to their [News](https://gajim.org/post/) section for all the details.

{{< figure src="/images/newsletter/2025-05-05/gajim-account-select.png" caption="Account and status selection in Gajim 2.1" >}}

- [Kaidan](https://www.kaidan.im/) has received [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) funding for [various improvement across the board](https://nlnet.nl/project/Kaidan-MUC/), most notably multi-user chat and support for legacy OMEMO. The second point is significant because while Kaidan is using a newer version of the OMEMO end-to-end encryption protocol, other popular clients including Conversations, Monal, and Dino are still using an older version. Since the two are not compatible, this meant Kaidan users were unable to use OMEMO encryption with users of most other clients. By implementing the older spec as well, Kaidan will help bridge that gap.

- [Monocles Chat 2.0.6](https://codeberg.org/monocles/monocles_chat/releases/tag/CodebergRelease-v2.0.6) has been released for Android. This version brings initial support for file captions, the option to pin an unencrypted message to the top of a conversation, providers list support, and the option to register on your own XMPP server, among many other new features and improvements.

{{< figure src="/images/newsletter/2025-05-05/monocles-pin-message.png" caption="Monocles Chat 2.0.6: Initial captions to files and pin message to the top" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/newsletter/2025-05-05/monocles-providers.png" caption="Monocles Chat 2.0.6: Register on your own XMPP server or pick one from the providers list" >}}
 
- [Movim](https://movim.eu/) has released version [0.30](https://mov.im/community/pubsub.movim.eu/Movim/good-news-everyone-movim-0-30-encke-is-there-xMvYPr) (code named "[Encke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke)"), the biggest Movim evolution in many years! This release brings [multi-participant calls](https://movim.eu/#visio), reactions being displayed in the detailed message view, support for Unicode 15.1 with plenty of new emojis to use, and avatars that change when a contact adds to their [Story](https://movim.eu/#stories).

{{< figure src="/images/newsletter/2025-05-05/movim-visio.jpg" caption="Movim 0.30 (Encke): Multi Participant Calls. Bob Cat looking disgruntled by the presence of the 'Hooman' on the lower right of the screen!" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/newsletter/2025-05-05/movim-visio-phone.jpg" caption="Movim 0.30 (Encke): Meow OwO bedazzled by the looks of Multi Participant Calls on his mobile device!" >}}

  - and following right on its heels, [Movim](https://movim.eu/) also published its first bug-fix release: version [0.30.1](https://mov.im/community/pubsub.movim.eu/Movim/here-comes-the-new-movim-release-encke-0-30-1-ckTLY4), adding animated pictures support in the image proxy and a new Avatar and Banner Configuration Panel, as well as implementing ([XEP-0392](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0392.html)) Consistent Color Generation, among many other improvements and bugfixes.

### XMPP Servers

- [MongooseIM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/technologies/mongooseim/) has released version [6.3.3](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/releases/tag/6.3.3) of its Enterprise Instant Messaging Solution.

- [Prosody IM](https://prosody.im/) is pleased to announce version [13.0.1](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-13.0.1-released/), a new minor release from the latest stable branch. It fixes some important bugs that were discovered after the latest release. Read all the details on the release [changelog](https://prosody.im/doc/release/13.0.1). As always, detailed download and install instructions are available on the [download page](https://prosody.im/download/) for your convenience.
- The [Prosody app for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/prosody_ynh) has been updated to provide a bunch of [supported XEPs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YunoHost-Apps/prosody_ynh/refs/heads/master/xmpp_compliance) by default, configured for all YunoHost users in just one click. [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org/) is a set of tools to easily manage your own selfhosted services, and while it used to come bundled with the Prosody fork Metronome by default, it has recently bundled its XMPP functionality into a separate "app" so that people can swap in any other XMPP server of their choice.

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

- No New XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.1.3 of [XEP-0313](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) (Message Archive Management)
  - Fixed typo (XEP Editor (dg))
- Version 0.4.0 of [XEP-0377](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0377.html) (Spam Reporting)
  - Add spam report processing opt-in.
  - Add Guus der Kinderen as co-author. (gdk)
- Version 1.0.1 of [XEP-0421](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0421.html) (Occupant identifiers for semi-anonymous MUCs)
  - Fixed typo (XEP Editor (dg))
- Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0455](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0455.html) (Service Outage Status)
  - Remove all in-band event signaling. (mp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- No XEPs moved to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.
