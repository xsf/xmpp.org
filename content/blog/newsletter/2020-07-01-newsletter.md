Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of June 2020.

## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you to [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful!
Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:
- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Translations: especially German and Spanish

### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

- French on [linuxfr.org](https://linuxfr.org/tags/xmpp/public) and [jabberfr.org](https://news.jabberfr.org/category/newsletter/).

## XSF Announcements

JC Brand created an [XMPP job board](https://xmpp.work/)! It enables people to review job offers as well as advertise XMPP services. Please take a look, post your own offers and recommend it. XMPP works!

## Article

Ingo J√ºrgensmann wrote an article on the backround of the 'Jabber' and 'XMPP' terminology and their [differences and similarities](https://blog.windfluechter.net/content/blog/2020/06/09/1758-jabber-vs-xmpp).

:de: The XMPP client Dino is one out of three projects which were awarded with the [10th Thomas Krenn Award](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/unternehmen/presse/pressemeldung.thomas-krenn-award-2020.html).

Micha≈Ç Piotrowski wrote an article on [how to quick start Instant Messaging implementation to an app](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/add-value-to-your-app-with-instant-messaging-here-s-where-to-start.html). He discusses the value of a chat feature in an app, scalability, customising and common mistakes: 'Choose your XEP, and choose wisely.'

:fr: Linuxfr.org user Space_e_man proposed his short overview of [Quicksy the easy XMPP based libre instant messaging platform](https://linuxfr.org/users/space_e_man/journaux/quicksy-la-messagerie-instantanee-libre-basee-sur-xmpp-facile). While the article itself concentrates on the reasons why it should be prefered to other proprietary solutions, the comments of linuxfr.org users, as usual, bring a lot of various points of view, as well as alternatives.

## Video

:es: Conociendo XMPP - The 'Comunidad Latina de Tecnolog√≠as Libres' had an online introduction to XMPP for users back in April 2020. We would like to [point you to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwnzJ9V732E), even if it is a bit late. They also offer a user chat reachable under this (short and handy) address
[comunidadlatinadetecnologiaslibres@chat.disroot.org](xmpp:comunidadlatinadetecnologiaslibres@chat.disroot.org?join).

Daniel Gultsch and Holger Weiss had a [virtual talk on their A/V implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_riuu4XU6Q) in Conversation and they described the technical details. The session was finalized with a second talk by eta who defined love by this formula: Asterisk + XMPP = <3

:de: Prof. Dr. P. L√∂bbecke spoke in a virtual talk about "[Freie Messenger - Sichere Kommunikation](https://libre.video/videos/watch/1b646209-24e0-489b-8060-793f4513da9d)" ('Free Messengers - Secure Communication') which also included XMPP (German).

## Software news

### Clients and applications

[Gajim 1.2.0](https://gajim.org/post/2020-06-21-gajim-1.2.0-released/) has been released. More than a year after the release of Gajim 1.1.3, it is finally time for Gajim 1.2. A year put at use to develop new features, clean up old code, and fix bugs. Highlights of this release are (amongst others): improved group chat system, completely rewritten network code, and a new account creation assistant. And there is much more to discover.
[Gajim Development News](https://gajim.org/post/2020-06-28-development-news-june/): June already brought Gajim 1.2, python-nbxmpp 1.0, and many plugin updates. But there is more: Blind Trust Before Verification for OMEMO, drag and drop improvements, and a new translation service for Gajim.

## Libraries

Gajim‚Äôs XMPP library '[python-nbxmpp](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/tree/master)' had its 1.0 release.

If you‚Äôre interested, there is a simple example client included.
