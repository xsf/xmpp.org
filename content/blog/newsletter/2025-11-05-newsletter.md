## XSF Announcements

Healthcare messaging must be secure, interoperable, and compliant, yet too often relies on closed consumer platforms. In the Netherlands, the forthcoming NTA 7532 specification aims to provide a national framework for secure, auditable communication between healthcare professionals.

To this effect, the XMPP Standards Foundation published the ['Towards Secure and Interoperable Healthcare Chat'](2025/10/towards-secure-and-interoperable-healthcare-chat/) open letter, in order to explain how the XMPP standard offers a proven foundation for NTA 7532, supporting vendor-independent and interoperable messaging. By engaging with initiatives like NTA 7532, the XSF promotes open, privacy-respecting communication technologies and invites collaboration with Dutch healthcare stakeholders and the global XMPP community.

### XSF Membership

If you are interested in joining the XMPP Standards Foundation as a member, [please apply before November 23th, 2025, 00:00 UTC](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Membership_Applications_Q4_2025).

### XMPP at Hack or Di(y|e) 2025

[Vril](https://mastodon.bida.im/@thevril) will host the [*XMPP - Iniziamo ad usare sistemi compagni di chat (se chattiamo*](https://hacklabbo.indivia.net/hackordiye25/programma/#xmpp---iniziamo-ad-usare-sistemi-compagni-di-chat-se-chattiamo) talk and workshop at the [Hack or Di(y|e) 2025](https://hacklabbo.indivia.net/hackordiye25/) in Bologna, **Italy**, on this next November 7th and 8th, 2025.

The talk will be as accessible as possible in terms of vocabulary. Aiming to give an overview of the XMPP protocol and what are the methodologies to start using it immediately through applications installed on your smartphone or PC. Immediately after the talk, the Workshop will move to a corner of the [VAG61](https://mastodon.bida.im/@vag61) to help each other install applications and create accounts on companion servers to immediately start chatting via XMPP and 1000 different accounts! + chaos!!. 
P.S. if you already want to get informed, here is a nice guide: [XMPP Guide](https://wiki.xmpp-it.net/xmpp-it:guide:indice). [IT]

- **Date**: November 7th and 8th, 2025.

  - The XMPP Standards Foundation [has put out a call to action](/2025/10/towards-secure-and-interoperable-healthcare-chat/): it’s time for the community to help make secure, interoperable chat a reality - especially in healthcare. At [Ignite Realtime](https://www.igniterealtime.org/), we’re excited to support this effort. Our projects, such as [Openfire](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/) and [Smack](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/), provide powerful building blocks to explore what’s possible for Dutch healthcare communication.

  - [Putting NTA 7532 to the Test (Literally)](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/2025/10/28/putting-nta7532-to-the-test.html): If you’re building a chat system that has to _actually talk_ to someone else’s chat system (and keep doctors happy while doing it), you’ll know: writing a specification is only half the battle. The other half is making sure that everyone follow it, and that everyone follows it in the same way. That’s where the **XMPP Interop Testing Framework** comes in.

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [No-reply JIDs](/extensions/inbox/no-reply-jids.html)
  - This specification defines a way for JIDs to advertise that they don’t accept incoming chat messages.
- [Forums](/extensions/inbox/forums.html)
  - This specification describes how to implement XMPP-based discussion forums.
- [Jingle Content Category](/extensions/inbox/jingle-content-category.html)
  - This specification defines an XMPP extension to negotiate the use of Session Description Protocol (SDP) media- level attribute ` content` as defined by [RFC 4796](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4796) with [Jingle RTP sessions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html).

### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0506](/extensions/xep-0506.html) (No-reply JIDs) has been released.
  - Accepted as Experimental by council vote (dg)

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.
