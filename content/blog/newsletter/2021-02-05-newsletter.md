Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of December 2020 and January 2021.

Happy to have you back reading! We hope this year will be a great one for you, but as well for XMPP!

In December 2020 we discussed the last year of producing and publishing of the XMPP Newsletter, [read the notes here](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pull/851#issuecomment-754919811)!

Many projects and their efforts in the XMPP community are a result of people’s voluntary work. If you are happy with the services and software you may be using, especially throughout the last year, please consider to say thanks or help these projects!

### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

- French on [linuxfr.org](https://linuxfr.org/tags/xmpp/public) and [jabberfr.org](https://news/jabberfr.org/category/newsletter/).

## XSF Announcement

Regarding the announcement by Let's Encrypt to switch away from their Root CA certificate: Now they are extending their [Android device compatibility of their certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html). [Read their the original post](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html). 

Edward Maurer wrote a commentary blog post regarding on the current situation of instant messaging communication and XMPP: [Instant Messaging: It's not about the app](https://xmpp.org/2021/01/instant-messaging-its-not-about-the-app/). There are also translations in [German](https://xmpp.org/2021/01/instant-messaging-es-geht-nicht-um-die-app/), [French](https://xmpp.org/2021/01/messagerie-instantanee-il-ne-sagit-pas-de-lapplication/), [Spanish](https://xmpp.org/2021/01/mensajeria-instantanea-no-se-trata-de-la-aplicacion/) and [Romanian](https://xmpp.org/2021/01/mesagerie-instantanee-nu-este-vorba-despre-aplicatie/).

## Events

[Berlin XMPP Meetup (remote)](https://mov.im/?node/pubsub.movim.eu/berlin-xmpp-meetup): Monthly Meeting of XMPP Enthusiasts in Berlin - always 2nd Wednesday of
every month

## Articles 

The developers of the Prosody XMPP server wrote [a recap post of 2020](https://blog.prosody.im/2020-retrospective/) summarizing what happened to the project in the past year. The post contains some nice statistics about how many Prosody deployments are running around the world.

Wolthera wrote another article explaining how to write a [XMPP Client in Godot](https://wolthera.info/2020/12/xmpp-client-in-godot/).

The developers at [blabber.im](https://blabber.im) did a short review of their [2020 statistics](https://blabber.im/en/das-jahr-2020-im-rueckblick/) (DE), giving interesting insights about server traffic, registered users, and more. blabber.im is the new home of Pix-Art Messenger, a Conversations fork which had to [rename itself due to legal issues with a company using a similar sounding name](https://blabber.im/en/wie-pix-art-messenger-aus-dem-google-play-store-verschwand/). Pix-Art Messenger is [now available using the name blabber.im](https://blabber.im/en/blabber-im-v3-0-0-verfuegbar/), offering the same features Pix-Art did.

Paula Kreuzer made a nice [embroidery of the XMPP logo](https://pixelfed.de/p/paulakreuzer/256133901083348992)!

XMPP Refresher: The Open Instant Messaging Protocol Then & Now. XMPP remains a critical framework for chat and messaging applications 20+ years after its launch. [Here’s how it works](https://getstream.io/blog/xmpp-extensible-messaging-presence-protocol/).

In his blog, Dryusdan shares [his recipe](https://dryusdan.space/installer-son-serveur-xmpp-100-conforme-aux-xep/) (FR) for deploying his own XMPP service, with the following main ingredients: Debian or Ubuntu, ejabberd and PostgreSQL. This recipe guarantees a 100% score on the well-known Conversations Compliance test.
 
Nicoco explains [why and how](https://linuxfr.org/users/therealnicoco/journaux/ma-passerelle-xmpp-signal) (FR) he created his own XMPP/signal gateway, called [spectrum2_signald](https://gitlab.com/nicocool84/spectrum2_signald/). Not perfect yet (only one signal account is currently supported) but it is open-source!

MongooseIM published an article on [privacy and security within instant messaging](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/how-to-ensure-your-instant-messaging-solution-offers-users-privacy-and-security/).

Tails ships with an XMPP client which currently is Pidgin. For security reasons [Tails is going to replace it](https://fosstodon.org/@tails/105587047791026258). A new XMPP client that Tails likely is going to install will be either [Dino](https://fosstodon.org/@dino) or [Gajim](https://fosstodon.org/@gajim).

The German newspaper "taz" mentions XMPP in general and Conversations and Quicksy in particular in an [article about alternatives to WhatsApp](https://taz.de/Alternative-Messenger-Dienste/!5743214/).

["XMPP - was ist das?"](https://www.heise.de/tipps-tricks/XMPP-was-ist-das-5006209.html) (DE) article in the German "heise online tipps + tricks" magazine.

Axel Reimer published a startup guide for Siskin IM in his blog. It is available in [English](https://xmppeinrichtung.blogspot.com/2021/01/installation-and-configuration-of.html) and [German](https://xmppeinrichtung.blogspot.com/2021/01/siskin-im-auf-dem-iphone-als-instant.html).

(A little bit too late, but interesting for iOS developer: [Chris Beckstrom explains how he bridged iMessage and XMPP](https://chrisbeckstrom.com/posts/How-I-Bridged-iMessage-and-XMPP/))

[Movim also had to upgrade their server capacity](https://nl.movim.eu/?node/pubsub.movim.eu/Movim/156c9c91-bbe3-45f0-a5df-1016d641ede6) in order to deal with the sudden subscription of hundreds of new users both on our XMPP #services movim.eu and jappix.com and on #Movim itself. The new official Movim pod is now located at [mov.im](https://mov.im) and the rest of the services (XMPP, Telegram/Slack/IRC bridges…) are now deployed on the new server. A warm welcome to all new users that joined Movim in the past few days!

The Ignite Realtime community [announces the availability of Openfire Pàdé v1.2.2](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-pade-1-2-0-released/89294) and Openfire [Pàdé v1.3.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-meetings-becomes-pade/89401). This release combines all Openfire Meetings modules (jitsi meet, videobridge, focus and sip gateway) and converse.js into a single plugin called Pàdé and fixes some issues.

[Profanity 0.10.0 has been relased](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity/releases/tag/0.10.0). The goal for this release was mostly internal cleanup, but there have also been some improvements under the hood for MAM ([XEP-0313](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html)).

[Quicksy.im](https://quicksy.im/), a Conversations Easy Entry and Easy Discovery spin-off, has grown its user count [by more than 30%](https://twitter.com/iNPUTmice/status/1351613901104963592) over the last two weeks. Quicksy 2.9.6 now supports automatic processing of received verification SMS.

[SàT progress note 2020-W53](https://www.goffi.org/b/LFMqr7xC2aNf4MDgkbamBY/progress-note): Full-Text Search in PubSub, easy invitations for sharing files, and more.

[SiskinIM 6.2 has been released](https://mastodon.technology/@tigase/105627824140193490), bringing support for OMEMO encrypted group chats (private group chats only), and fixing issues with VoIP.

[UWPX `v.0.30.0.0`](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.30.0.0) has been released and with it comes a first experimental implementation of [XEP-0313 (MAM)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html). Besides the introduction of [XEP-0313 (MAM)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html) to [UWPX](https://uwpx.org/) a bunch of smaller bugs have been fixed and the overall [XEP-0384 (OMEMO Encryption)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) experience has been improved. Those were all the features that made it into the current release, but there is far more to come in the future since [COM8](https://github.com/COM8) is working on upgrading his [XEP-0384 (OMEMO Encryption)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) to the latest version (`0.7.0 (2020-09-05)`). Besides that a complete database overhaul is also work in progress (switch from [SQLite-net DB](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) to the [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)).

## Servers

[ejabberd 20.12 has been released](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-20-12/), including several new features and many improvements & bugfixes (e.g. new authentification methods, and database drivers).

[Openfire 4.6.1](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-6-1-is-released/89430) has been released. This version is largely a bugfix release. It primarily focuses on improving multi-user chat and pubsub functionality when running an Openfire cluster, but also includes other improvements, such as LDAP/AD performance enhancements. You can find all changes in the changelog, which is denoting 33 issues resolved since 4.6.0.

## Libraries

Gajim’s XMPP library [python-nbxmpp had its 2.0.0 release](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/blob/master/ChangeLog), adding support for [XEP-0106: JID Escaping](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0106.html), [XEP-0292: vCard4 Over XMPP](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0292.html), and [XEP-0233: XMPP Server Registration for use with Kerberos V5](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0233.html).

[slixmpp 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 have been released](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp/-/releases#slix-1.7.0). Those releases bring support for many new XEPs (including some MIX XEPs), along with fixes, and improvements.

Ignite Realtime developers are [happy to announce Smack 4.4.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-0-released/89283), which is the first major release since the release of Smack 4.3.0 in August 2018 and includes many new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   [XEP-0381](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0381.html) Internet of Things Special Interest Group (IoT SIG)

### Draft

-   No Drafts this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
