Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of August 2020.

### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

- French on [linuxfr.org](https://linuxfr.org/tags/xmpp/public) and [jabberfr.org](https://news/jabberfr.org/category/newsletter/)


## Articles

Lorenz Kästle wrote an article (in German and English) on [how to setup an Icinga 2 notification system using python3-slixmpp](https://www.netways.de/blog/2020/08/28/zurueck-in-die-zukunft-icinga2-benachrichtigungen-mit-xmpp/) ([reposity on Github](https://github.com/RincewindsHat/icinga2_xmpp-notifications)).

## Software news

### Clients and applications

The multi-platform desktop client [Gajim 1.2.2 has been released](https://gajim.org/post/2020-08-15-gajim-1.2.2-released/). It brings an automatic weekly update check for Gajim on Windows and MacOS, a big status message overhaul, and many improvements. [More development news from August](https://gajim.org/post/2020-08-30-development-news-august/): The settings backend received an upgrade to migrate from text files to SQLite based storage, and a lot of code has been cleaned up, which should make it easier for you to handle all of Gajim’s configuration possiblities.

The iOS and macOS client Monal is now managing translations on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/monal/). 27 languages are waiting for excellent and native speakers! Please also check out the current [Monal Beta 4.7.0](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/releases/tag/Build_iOS_636) and get ready for the upcoming release!

There have been UI and file sharing improvements on the "[Salut à Toi](https://salut-a-toi.org/)" project:

- Libervia, the web frontend, has seen a major UI revamp, with a new theme based on Bulma CSS framework. The [W31 progress note](https://www.goffi.org/b/n9nzn3ySF7Lv4pYBpTqYtP/progress-note) also explains how the templating engine Nunjucks is used in the browser to use the same templates as in the Jinja 2 based backend.  

- The file sharing component included in SàT now implements [XEP-0363](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) (HTTP File Upload), which completes the [XEP-0234](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0234.html) (Jingle File Transfer) method. Files uploaded to this component from any XMPP client will appear in SàT's file sharing UI, and can be deleted from there or with [XEP-0050](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html) (Ad-Hoc Commands).  

- Libervia photo album has been greatly improved with a mobile and desktop friendly slideshow, easy way to upload files from browser, and integration of videos. Work is currently in progress to make SàT/Libervia a good fit for an XMPP based familial social network, with a release expected around the end of September or beginning of October.

The Android client aTalk 2.4.0 has been released. [Changes](https://github.com/cmeng-git/atalk-android/blob/master/aTalk/ReleaseNotes.txt) are mainly internal with several libraries upgrades and compilation fixes. It was followed by version 2.4.1 which fixes an Android Q specific storage issue.

The desktop client [Dino received a NGI0 PET Fund](https://dino.im/blog/2020/08/setting-out-for-calls-and-conferences/) managed by NLnet which receives financial support from the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet program. This allows the developers to dedicate time and efforts to implement video and audio calls into their client. This is really great news!

The multi-platform client [Kaidan 0.6.0 has been released](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/08/20/kaidan-0.6.0/). The update includes stability fixes, a new offline message queue, and improved message correction. Furthermore, the upstream HTTP File Upload implementation of its XMPP library [QXmpp](https://github.com/qxmpp-project/qxmpp) is used now.

![Kaidan offline message queue](/images/newsletter/august2020/kaidan060.gif "Kaidan offline message queue") 

Spark, the multi-platform client from the Ignite RealTime community, has released its long overdue [version 2.9.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/spark-2-9-0-released/88551), with improvement in certificates management, and additional file transfer methods. It was followed by 2.9.1 and 2.9.2. Go ahead and check the [changelog](http://download.igniterealtime.org/spark/docs/latest/changelog.html) for the numerous bug fixes and improvements.

## Servers

The java based Tigase XMPP Server [is now available as a Docker image](https://tigase.net/tigase-meets-docker/) to facilitate its deployment on your server.

The Ignite Realtime community XMPP server, Openfire, has a [new plugin](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/jsxc-web-client-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-openfire/88467)  to make the JSXC web client available to its users.

## Libraries

The Ignite RealTime community modular XMPP client library Smack has [had its first beta release](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-0-beta1-released/88519) for the upcoming release of Smack version 4.4! The [list of changes](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/wiki/Smack-4.4-Readme-and-Upgrade-Guide) ranges from a new modular transport API which makes it easy to swap the underlying transport mechanism of an XMPP connection during runtime, to added support for [XEP-0373](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0373.html) (OpenPGP for XMPP), [XEP-0424](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html) (Message Retraction), and about a dozen other specifications. As usual, it's available on Maven Central.

python-nbxmpp, the library powering Gajim, had it’s [1.0.2 release](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/tags/nbxmpp-1.0.2). The latest version contains some domain mapping improvements and fixes network issues which occured under certain circumstances after suspending the device.

## Other

Want a coffee with a taste of XMPP? Over the past months [COM8](https://github.com/com8) has been working on creating a [reference implementation](https://github.com/COM8/esp32-jura) for his new XMPPIoT protocol. A first rather basic draft has been published in his [B.Sc. Thesis](https://home.in.tum.de/~sauterf/html-data/Thesis_Smart_Building_Control_with_XMPP_for_IoT.pdf). Using the Windows 10 [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) XMPP client [UWPX](https://uwpx.org), it is possible to register a JURA coffee maker as a new IoT device. This allows sending and receiving commands from and to it, using an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) from Espressif (low-power and low-cost system on a chip microcontroller). The ESP32 functions as a proxy between XMPP and the proprietary JURA protocol. A video of the working prototype [can be found on Twitter](https://twitter.com/UWPX_APP/status/1293461429677436931?s=20).
