### XMPP at FOSDEM 2026

During January 31st and February 1st, the XSF was present at [FOSDEM 26](https://fosdem.org/2026/) in Brussels, Belgium. The XMPP community took part of the Realtime Lounge, a room located in Level 1, AW building, where several open source projects around the [Decentralised Communication Devroom](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/decentralised-communication/) can present themselves.

We are pleased to say that there was a lot of interaction at the XMPP booth! A rather large number of FOSDEM visitors had the opportunity to come say “Hi!”, meet, interact, talk and have interesting conversations with many of the developers of the most popular clients, servers, tools and libraries that power the whole XMPP ecosystem and bring it to life.

In addition to the activities that took place on the XMPP booth, [Daniel Gultsch](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/daniel_gultsch/) and [S1m](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/s1m/), [Jérôme Sautret](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/jerome_sautret/), [Timothée Jaussoin](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/timothee_jaussoin/), and [Özcan Oğuz](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/ozcan_oguz/) hosted four different XMPP related presentations the Decentralised Communication Developer Room and the [FOSS on Mobile](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/foss-on-mobile/) track.

And, of course .. we had plenty of leaflets, informational material, and as always: the coolest stickers! ;)

### XMPP Servers

- [Prosody IM](https://prosody.im/) is pleased to announce versions [13.0.3](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-13.0.3-released/) and [13.0.4](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-13.0.4-released/), both minor releases of the stable branch. The former comes with a range of tweaks, bug fixes and minor improvements, and the latter being the encouraged upgrade, partly due to a bug that was introduced into UUID generation in the previous release. Although not strictly bug fixes, some configuration-related improvements that help make configuring Prosody a little easier and more reliable also made their way into the latest release. Read all the details on the [changelog](https://prosody.im/doc/release/13.0.4), and as always, detailed download and install instructions are available on the [download page](https://prosody.im/download/) for your convenience.
- [MongooseIM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/technologies/mongooseim/) has released [MongooseIM 6.5: Open for Integration](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/mongooseim-6-5-open-for-integration/). This release focuses on easier integration with your applications while continuing to deliver a scalable and reliable XMPP-based messaging server. The most important improvement in MongooseIM 6.5.0 is the production-ready integration with [RabbitMQ](https://esl.github.io/MongooseDocs/latest/modules/mod_event_pusher_rabbit/), allowing external services to process the events from the server. It is worth noting that the mechanism is highly extensible – you can craft such extensions yourself.
- [ProcessOne](https://www.process-one.net/) is pleased to announce the release of [ejabberd 26.01](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-26-01/). This release addresses real operational pain points: export your data from one database backend and import it into another, and [roster invites and invite-based account registration](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration/modules/?ref=process-one.net#mod_invites) to let your users invite others without opening the gates to spam! Make sure to read the [changelog](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/compare/25.10...26.01?ref=process-one.net) for all the details and a complete list of changes, new features, fixes and improvements on this release.

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [End-to-End Encrypted Contacts Metadata](/extensions/inbox/contacts-e2e.html)
  - This specification describes how to encrypt contacts metadata to minimize server exposure.

### New

- No new XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.1.0 of [XEP-0386](/extensions/xep-0386.html) (Bind 2) 
  - It's authorization-identifier not authorization-identity (dg)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No XEPs last calls this month.

### Stable

- No stable XEPs this month.

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.
