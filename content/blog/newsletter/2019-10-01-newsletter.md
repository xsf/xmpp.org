## Articles

Ralph Meijer, chairman of the Board of Directors of the XSF, has written an introductory piece about "[XMPP Message Attaching, Fastening, References](https://ralphm.net/blog/2019/09/09/fastening)", specifications currently in progress.

In case of internet shut down, whether by disaster or voluntarily, peer networks are useful. [Monal uses Airdrop](http://monal.im/blog/xmppsignalbluetoothp2p-wifi-serverless-chat/) (wifi and bluetooth) along with XMPP and OMEMO end-to-end encryption.

JabberFr, the French XMPP/Jabber community, has again [translated the XMPP newsletter in French](https://news.jabberfr.org/2019/09/lettre-dactualite-xmpp-du-3-septembre-2019/), merci beaucoup.

We have started a very minimalistic [communication guide](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Basic_communication_guide_for_XMPP_techies) to help promoting a project through social networks and other means such as blog posts. Could be valuable for those involved in XMPP projects and would like to get ideas on how to reach out to different communities.

## Events

As usual every year, that time has come: we proudly announce the XMPP Summit 24 and the XSF participation to [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/). The 24th XMPP Summit will happen on Thursday 30th and Friday 31st of January, and FOSDEM will be held on Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd of February. Prepare for the community gathering; now is a good time to start booking your flights!
