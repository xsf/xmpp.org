- [XMPP Interop Testing](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/)
  - [Lots More Options!](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/2025/09/14/lots-more-options.html): A slew of new CI systems have been added. This time the target was freedom-respecting, open source CI systems for your open source projects ( including [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Drone](https://www.drone.io/), [Harness](https://www.harness.io/) and [Woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) ). This brings the total number of CI systems in which you can run XMPP interop tests up to a whopping ELEVEN, plus anywhere else you can run containers. If there’s a CI system that you’re using and you’d like to see supported, or if it's already supported but you’re struggling, [please join their MUC](xmpp:interop@conference.igniterealtime.org?join), or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/XMPP-Interop-Testing/smack-sint-server-extensions). By [Dan Caseley](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/contact) for the [XMPP Interop Testing Blog](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/blog).
  - [Two New Features for Clearer Testing](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/2025/09/26/new-features-for-clearer-testing.html): Has released version 1.7.1 of all of its test runners. This release adds two improvements to make interop testing both stricter and easier to set up! Now you can configure the suite to treat impossible tests as failures, ensuring that a green run really means every configured test executed and passed. You can now choose from three provisioning methods:
    - Admin Account using [XEP-0133](/extensions/xep-0133.html) (Service Administration) to create test accounts.
    - Explicit Test Accounts you configure up front.
    - In-Band Registration via [XEP-0077](/extensions/xep-0077.html) (In-Band Registration).
    Pick the approach that fits your setup best. There is [documentation](https://xmpp-interop-testing.github.io/documentation/provisioning-accounts) available for you to review the finer details!
- [Libervia CLI tips](https://mastodon.social/@Goffi/tagged/tips): Did you know that [Liverbia](https://libervia.org/) has a [CLI](https://libervia.org/__b/doc/backend/libervia-cli/) that you can use to do nearly everything with? Well, that's right, and [Goffi](https://mastodon.social/@Goffi), its author, has been steadily publishing a series of Mastodon toots to help you make the most out of it! Share files, publish blog posts, send encrypted messages, make audio/video calls, encrypt a pubsub node, automate tasks with ad-hoc commands, etc; everything from the comfort of your terminal!

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [Pubsub Node Bookmark](/extensions/inbox/pubsub-node-bookmark.html)
  - This specification defines a bookmark element pointing to a Pubsub node.

### New

- No New XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 0.3.1 of [XEP-0317](/extensions/xep-0317.html) (Hats)
  - Typos, completed some examples and paragraph clarifications thanks to badlop feedback. (tj)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0503](/extensions/xep-0503.html) (Server-side spaces)
  - Rewrite using pubsub semantics. (nc)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- No XEPs moved to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.

## XMPP Public channels

New rooms and public channels are created on a daily basis on the XMPP network. So, if you are on the look out for new and exciting public channels to join, make sure to check out the [Public Channel Search Engine](https://search.jabber.network/search) to find out groups or communities that share your interests!

- If you want to list all the channels, you can find them [here](https://search.jabber.network).
- If you are interested on something in particular, [look by tag](https://search.jabber.network/tags/)!
- If you only want to list rooms in a particular language just add `lang:xx` in the search box, like in this example for the [Spanish language](https://search.jabber.network/search?q=lang%3Aes&f=y&sinaddr=on&sindescr=on&sinname=on). Just make sure to replace `es` for your desired language (like `lang:fr`, `lang:de`, `lang:pt` and so on).
