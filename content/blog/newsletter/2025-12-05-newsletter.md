## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0507](/extensions/xep-0507.html) (Jingle Content Category)
  - Accepted as Experimental by council vote (dg)

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.30.0 of [XEP-0060](/extensions/xep-0060.html) (Publish-Subscribe)
  - Describe the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub' `disco#info feature` (gdk)
- Version 0.5 of [XEP-0440](/extensions/xep-0440.html) (SASL Channel-Binding Type)
  - Address a possible MITM attack vector by making the tls-server-end-point channel-binding mandatory to implement
  - Remove the whole 'Interaction with SASL mechanisms' section and replace it with 'Business Rules'
  - Rework whole 'Security Considerations' section
  - Some minor editorial changes
  - Add Thilo Molitor as author (tm)
- Version 0.5.0 of [XEP-0474](/extensions/xep-0474.html) (SASL SCRAM Downgrade)
  - Add business rules describing client behavior
  - Make clear that PLAIN still has to be pinned away, if not disabled entirely (tm)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0492](/extensions/xep-0492.html) (Chat notification settings)
  - Rework the spec to use more of the Service Discovery Identities registry
  - Fix the XML schema
  - Move the `<advanced/>` element into the notification setting element
  - Bump the namespace (tm)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0485](/extensions/xep-0485.html) (PubSub Server Information)
  - Accept as Stable as per Council Vote from 2025-11-11 (XEP Editor(dg))

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.

## XMPP Public channels

New rooms and public channels are created on a daily basis on the XMPP network. So, if you are on the look out for new and exciting public channels to join, make sure to check out the [Public Channel Search Engine](https://search.jabber.network/search) to find out groups or communities that share your interests!

- If you want to list all the channels, you can find them [here](https://search.jabber.network).
- If you are interested on something in particular, [look by tag](https://search.jabber.network/tags/)!
- If you only want to list rooms in a particular language just add `lang:xx` in the search box, like in this example for the [Spanish language](https://search.jabber.network/search?q=lang%3Aes&f=y&sinaddr=on&sindescr=on&sinname=on). Just make sure to replace `es` for your desired language (like `lang:fr`, `lang:de`, `lang:pt` and so on).
