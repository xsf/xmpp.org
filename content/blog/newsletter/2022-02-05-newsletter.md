## Software news

### Clients and applications

[Gajim development news](https://gajim.org/post/2022-01-22-development-news-december-january/): Work on Gajim `1.4` is making big steps forward! After nine months of developing Gajim’s new main window, the code was finally ready to be merged into the master branch. This enables automatic builds of nightly versions for Linux and Windows.

[monocles chat](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.monocles.chat/) (a fork of Conversations and Blabber.im) will get OTR support in the next release. The client also only allows connections to XMPP servers with up to date SSL configurations and does not offer fallback SSL connections to avoid data leaks. Nevertheless it is compatible with every current XMPP account.

[Libervia `0.8` "La Cecília"](https://www.goffi.org/b/libervia-v0-8-la-cecilia-BdQ4) (formerly known as "Salut à Toi") has been released with a complete OMEMO encrytion finalization for group chats, a new default theme, an easy to use invitation system, a non-standard (XMPP) list feature, photo albums and many technical changes.

A new stable release of [SiskinIM `7.0.1` has been published](https://github.com/tigase/siskin-im/releases/tag/7.0.1) which includes sending unencrypted messages in single chats with default encryption for OMEMO and presenting automatic file download size limit.

## Servers

[Openfire `4.7.0`](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-7-0-has-been-released/91268) has been released (having their [Beta released](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-7-0-beta-hazelcast-plugin-2-6-0-releases/91087) before). This release is the first non-patch release in more than a year, which brings a healthy amount of new features, as well as bug fixes. Highlights of this release include extensively improved clustering support, particularly around Multi-User Chat functionality, which should benefit high-volume environments. Previously also [Openfire `4.5.5`](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-6-6-and-4-5-5-releases-log4j-only-changes/91139), [Openfire `4.6.5`](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-6-5-released/91108) and [Openfire `4.6.6`](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-6-6-and-4-5-5-releases-log4j-only-changes/91139) have been released.

[Prosody `0.11.13`](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.11.13-released/) has been released. Since December, new Prosody releases brought some fixes to PEP to control memory usage, a security fix that addresses a denial-of-service vulnerability in Prosody’s mod_websocket, and a fix for a memory leak. Previously [Prosody `0.11.11`](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.11.11-released/) and [Prosody `0.11.12`](https://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0.11.12-released/) were released, too.

[ejabberd `21.12`](https://www.process-one.net/blog/ejabberd-21-12/) has been released. The new ejabberd 21.12 release comes after five months of work, contains more than one hundred changes, many of them are major improvements or features, and several bug fixes: PubSub improvements, new mod_conversejs, and support for MUC Hats ([XEP-0317](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0317.html)).

[Jackal](https://github.com/ortuman/jackal), an XMPP server written in Go, had [version `0.56.0`](https://github.com/ortuman/jackal/releases) released.

Snikket announced their [January 2022 server release](https://snikket.org/blog/jan-2022-server-release/), this includes a [security fix](https://snikket.org/blog/snikket-jan-2021-security-release/) announced earlier in January. The primary new feature in this release is account import/export functionality, the final part of the [XMPP account portability project](https://docs.modernxmpp.org/projects/portability/) funded by NGI DAPSI.

## Libraries

A [new XMPP component](https://gitlab.com/navlost.eu/xmpp/components/webhooks) has been published and could use some feedback. The component implements a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) transport that lets users (the person hosting the component and anyone they choose to allow) create HTTP endpoints to receive events on and translate those to XMPP messages. Webhook payloads are processed by middleware and the XMPP notifications are template-based and written in [EJS](https://ejs.co/ "Embedded JavaScript templating"). It currently comes with GitLab and plain Git integrations as well as a crude and untested Slack middleware, but it also understands plain text and PNG, JPEG and PDF content, which is sent to subscribers as attachments via [HTTP File Upload (XEP-0363)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html). Find the [main repository](https://gitlab.com/navlost.eu/xmpp/components/webhooks) (no production quality yet) and there is also a [demo server](https://gitlab.com/navlost.eu/xmpp/components/webhooks/-/blob/devel/README.md#demo-server) available for casual testing.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   [Compatibility Fallbacks](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/compatibility-fallback.html)
    -   This document defines a way to indicate that a specific part of the body only serves as fallback and which specification the fallback is for.

-   [Call Invites](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/call-invites.html)
    -   This document defines how to invite someone to a call and how to respond to the invite.

-   [PubSub Namespaces](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/pubsub-ns.html)
    -   This extension defines a new PubSub node attribute to specify the type of payload.

-   [Message Replies](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/replies.html)
    -   This document defines a way to indicate that a message is a reply to a previous message.

### New

-   No new XEPs this month.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version `1.1.0` of [XEP-0363](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html) (HTTP File Upload)
    -   Filename size in bytes.
    -   Headers MUST be included in the PUT request.
    -   Headers considered opaque.
    -   Servers may want to sign headers, in security implications.
    -   Allow header case insensitivity, multiple times the same header, and preserve the order in the HTTP request. (egp, mb)
    
-   Version `0.4.0` of [XEP-0353](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0353.html) (Jingle Message Initiation)
    -   Rework whole spec, namespace bump
    -   Add new `<finish/>` message
    -   Add dependency on XEP-0280, XEP-0313 and XEP-0334
    -   Add `<reason/>` to some messages (tm)

-   Version `1.1.0` of [XEP-0459](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0459.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2022)
    -   Replace deprecated XEP-0411 with XEP-0402 in Advanced Group Chat (egp)

-   Version `0.4.0` of [XEP-0380](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0380.html) (Explicit Message Encryption)
    -   Add new OMEMO namespaces: 'urn:xmpp:omemo:1' for OMEMO versions since `0.4.0`, and 'urn:xmpp:omemo:2' for OMEMO versions since `0.8.0` (melvo)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

-   Last Call for comments on [XEP-0424](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html) (Message Retraction)
-   Last Call for comments on [XEP-0425](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0425.html) (Message Moderation)

### Stable (formerly known as Draft)

Info: The XSF has decided to rename 'Draft' to 'Stable'. [Read more about it here.](https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/1100)

-   No XEPs advanced to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

-   [XEP-0256](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0256.html) (Last Activity in Presence)

### Obsoleted

-   [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
