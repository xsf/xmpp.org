# The 50th release of the XMPP Newsletter!

This is the 50th release of the XMPP Newsletter since it started in February 2019.
We think it is worth to celebrate this achievement and say thanks to all the contributors as well as all our readers!
Back at the Summit in Brussels, JC Brand, Nicolas Vérité (Nyco) and Severino Ferrer (S0ul) proposed and initiated the XMPP Newsletter.
Since then almost every month there has been a release full of news from the XMPP universe.
Hence, we are looking forward to the next releases and invite you to participate in this community effort!
We would love to see more contributors as well as more translations of the XMPP Newsletter.
[Read more about how to help below.](#newsletter-contributors--translations)

That being said, welcome to the 50th edition of the XMPP Newsletter, great to have you here again!
This issue covers the month of March 2024.

## Talks

- Last November the [Linux Inlaws Podcast](https://linuxinlaws.eu/#episodes) hosted Edward and Matt from the XSF Board 2024.
The episode has been published recently and can be accessed via [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/LI_S02E06_XMPP__EA30/LI_S02E06_XMPP_.mp3).

## Articles

Axel Reimer published an XMPP app decision table. It compares typical instant messaging features of popular XMPP apps and might be a guideline for new users who want to try an XMPP app.
The table is available in [English](https://apps.xmpp24.de/english/) and [German](https://apps.xmpp24.de/deutsch/).

You can now ask all your questions about [XMPP Providers](https://providers.xmpp.net) in the new [support chat](https://providers.xmpp.net/blog/2024-03-11-xmpp-providers-chat/).
That chat is hosted on an own XMPP server which is set up with the new [XMPP Providers Server](https://providers.xmpp.net/blog/2024-03-28-xmpp-providers-server/) project.
It is a simple, Ansible-based all-in-one server setup that can be used for *your* own XMPP server as well.

[Snikket Hosting is now publicly available!](https://snikket.org/blog/snikket-hosting-launched/) The launch is about providing new ways to get started with Snikket, not replacing
the options that are already available. If you are already self-hosting Snikket, or planning to, nothing is changing for you.
Though please do [donate to support](https://snikket.org/donate/) the project, even a little helps!

Cheogram Android also receives an update with new features and a visual refresh. There's a clarification on contact integration, with Google now requiring the app claim to upload the contacts even though it does not.

[Release article](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/goodbye-pushover-hello-overpush/).

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](https://xmpp.org/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/).

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [Message Displayed Synchronization](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/xep-mds.html)
  - This specification allows multiple clients of the same user to synchronize the displayed state of their chats.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments.

## Help us to build the newsletter

This XMPP Newsletter is produced collaboratively by the XMPP community. Each month's newsletter issue is drafted in this [simple pad](https://pad.nixnet.services/oHnY_ZvLT8SoFyCqIC2ung).
