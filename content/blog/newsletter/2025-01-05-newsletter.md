### XMPP at FOSDEM 2025

- [Jérôme Poisson (Goffi)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/speaker/jerome_poisson_goffi/) presentation at [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/):
    - [A Universal and Stable API to Everything: XMPP](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5721-a-universal-and-stable-api-to-everything-xmpp/): "Nowadays, most services provide APIs with their own formats, and sometimes multiple versions, which may change over time. But there is a universal API, with an excellent track record of stability and backward compatibility: XMPP!. In this talk, I'll show how XMPP can be more than just an Instant Messaging protocol, and how it can be an extremely powerful tool to access almost anything, from third-party networks (IM, microblogging, etc.) to file sharing, automation (IoT), and more. ".
    The presentation will take place on Saturday, February 1st 2025, on the [Real Time Communications (RTC)](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/rtc/) track, room [K.3.601](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/room/k3601/), starting at 18:25 and ending at 18:40 hs.

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](https://xmpp.org/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/).

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0501](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0501.html) (Pubsub Stories).
  - Promoted to Experimental (XEP Editor: dg)
- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0502](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0502.html) (MUC Activity Indicator).
  -  Promoted to Experimental (XEP Editor: dg)

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0480](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0480.html) (SASL Upgrade Tasks).
  - Fix SCRAM upgrade description and XML schema. (tm)
- Version 0.1.1 of [XEP-0500](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0500.html) (MUC Slow Mode).
  - Include first feedbacks (jl)
- Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0501](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0501.html) (Pubsub Stories).
  - Add pubsub#item_expire in the node configuration (tj)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- Last Call for comments on [XEP-0421](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0421.html) (Anonymous unique occupant identifiers for MUCs).
  - This Last Call shall end at the close of business on 2025-01-06
- Last Call for comments on [XEP-0424](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html) (Message Retraction).
  - This Last Call shall end at the close of business on 2025-01-06

### Stable

- No XEPs moved to Stable this month.

### Deprecated
