  - [ejabberd Great Invitations](https://nlnet.nl/project/ejabberd-invites/): One of the biggest hurdles for XMPP in terms of widespread adoption compared to single vendor solutions is a somewhat more complicated onboarding process. The goal of this project is to make this process as seamless as possible by simplifying the onboarding process - a single link is enough to guide a potential future participant - and implement it for [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im/).
  - [Convo XMPP client](https://nlnet.nl/project/Convo/): The primary goal of this project is to develop Convo into a fully functional app that forms a viable messaging solution for [KaiOS](https://www.kaiostech.com/) users, and publish it on the official [KaiOS Store](https://www.kaiostech.com/store/), replace the UI with a better one based on the solid-telekram project, ensure compliance with the basic [XMPP Core](/rfcs/#6120) and [IM Compliance Suites](/about/compliance-suites/) (defined in [XEP-0479](/extensions/xep-0479.html)), as well as expose end-to-end encryption (OMEMO v0.3) functionality.

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](/rfcs/). Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/postorius/lists/standards.xmpp.org/) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/hyperkitty/list/standards@xmpp.org/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/). Within two weeks, the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

- No New XEPs this month.
 
### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.2.3 of [XEP-0167](/extensions/xep-0167.html) (Jingle RTP Sessions)
  - Make 'ssrc' attribute 'xs:unsignedInt' (32-bit) instead of 'xs:string' to match RFC3550. (lnj)
- Version 1.6.3 of [XEP-0198](/extensions/xep-0198.html) (Stream Management)
  - Remove leftover `<optional/>` and `<required/>` children in `<sm/>` element. (egp)
- Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0317](/extensions/xep-0317.html) (Hats)
  - Add hat creation and destruction flows; add hue optional parameter; add chatroom presence hats broadcast; complete disco#info; clarify how the service should broadcast updated hats; typos; standardize the form fields; (tj)
- Version 1.0.4 of [XEP-0388](/extensions/xep-0388.html) (Extensible SASL Profile)
  - Schema should use all instead of sequence (dg)
- Version 0.4.0 of [XEP-0455](/extensions/xep-0455.html) (Service Outage Status)
  - Remove leftover pubsub references, add accessibility considerations. (mp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the [Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/#council) decides whether the XEP seems ready, the [XMPP Editor](/about/xsf/editor-team/) issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- No XEPs moved to Stable this month.

### Deprecated

- No XEPs deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEPs rejected this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

This XMPP Newsletter is produced collaboratively by the XMPP community. Each month's newsletter issue is drafted in this [simple pad](https://pad.nixnet.services/oHnY_ZvLT8SoFyCqIC2ung). At the end of each month, the pad's content is merged into the [XSF GitHub repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. You have a project and want to spread the news? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience.

Tasks we do on a regular basis:

- gathering news in the XMPP universe
- *short* summaries of news and events
