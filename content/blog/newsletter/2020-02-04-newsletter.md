## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of January 2020, which has seen a lot of activity!

Please help us on this community effort, which [process is fully transparent and adaptable](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

## Articles 

Ingo Jürgensmann has written two interesting articles:

* [XMPP - Prosody & Ejabberd](https://blog.windfluechter.net/content/blog/2020/01/07/1754-xmpp-prosody-ejabberd)
* [XMPP - Fun with Clients](https://blog.windfluechter.net/content/blog/2020/01/18/1755-xmpp-fun-clients)

David Wong wrote an insightful point by point piece: [A history of end-to-end encryption and the death of PGP](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/487/a-history-of-end-to-end-encryption-and-the-death-of-pgp/)

This Twitter thread started by Thierry Stoehr shows [various use cases of XMPP in Instant Messaging](https://twitter.com/ThierryStoehr/status/1202978443048235009): healthcare, miltary, police and law enforcement, municipal services, intelligence agencies, in-games chat... Please "Like" and "Share", and even add the use cases you have seen in action.

Mike Kuketz started of a series about different messengers including XMPP: [Die verrückte Welt der Messenger – Messenger Teil1](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/die-verrueckte-welt-der-messenger-messenger-teil1/) (German).
