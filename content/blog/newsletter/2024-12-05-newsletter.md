### XMPP Servers

- [Openfire 4.9.1](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/openfire-4-9-1-release/94857) and [4.9.2](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/releases/tag/v4.9.2) have been released. Version [4.9.1](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/releases/tag/v4.9.1) is a bugfix and maintenance release, whereas version [4.9.2](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Openfire/releases/tag/v4.9.2) is a bugfix release. You can read the full [changelog](https://download.igniterealtime.org/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html) for more details.
- [MongooseIM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/technologies/mongooseim/) version [6.3.0](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/releases/tag/6.3.0) has been released. The main highlight is the complete instrumentation rework, allowing integration with Prometheus. Additionally, CockroachDB has been added to the list of supported databases for increased scalability. See the [release notes](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/releases/tag/6.3.0) for more information.
- The [(non-official) Prosody app](https://github.com/anubister/prosody_ynh) for Yunohost has now reached a beta maturity opening it for everybody to test. This variant aims at providing better XMPP support for Yunohost users. In comparison to official Metronome and Prosody apps, this app enables A/V calls working out of the box. An optional import of rosters, MUCs, and bookmarks from Metronome is also provided. As a reminder, Yunohost is a server distribution based on Debian, which makes it easy to host a lot of services (apps) by yourself. Till the last major release (version 12), Metronome was integrated in the core installation, allowing a lot of people to discover XMPP easier (though with some limitations).

## Extensions and specifications

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](https://xmpp.org/extensions/) in addition to [XMPP RFCs](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/).

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- No XEPs Proposed this month.

### New

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0496](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0496.html) (Pubsub Node Relationships)
  - Promoted to Experimental (XEP Editor: dg)
- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0497](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0497.html) (Pubsub Extended Subscriptions)

- Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0500](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0500.html) (MUC Slow Mode)
  - Promoted to Experimental (XEP Editor: dg)

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

- No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

- Version 1.0.1 of [XEP-0490](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0490.html) (Message Displayed Synchronization)
  - Fix some examples, and their indentation.
  - Add the XML Schema. (egp)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call can help improve the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Stable.

- No Last Call this month.

### Stable

- Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0490](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0490.html) (Message Displayed Synchronization)
  - Accept as Stable as per Council Vote from 2024-11-05. (XEP Editor (dg)

### Deprecated

- No XEP deprecated this month.

### Rejected

- No XEP rejected this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

This XMPP Newsletter is produced collaboratively by the XMPP community. Each month's newsletter issue is drafted in this [simple pad](https://pad.nixnet.services/oHnY_ZvLT8SoFyCqIC2ung). At the end of each month, the pad's content is merged into the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. You have a project and want to spread the news? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience.

Tasks we do on a regular basis:

- gathering news in the XMPP universe
- *short* summaries of news and events
- summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEPs)
- review of the newsletter draft
- preparation of media images
