Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of May 2020.

## Subscribe to the newsletter

We suggest you [Subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/xmpp) to receive the next editions in your inbox as soon as it is published! Promote this newsletter to whoever may be interested.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting every new issue in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
And we are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and (want to) write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! Even if you can only spend a few minutes, these would already be helpful.

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the draft
- Translations: especially French, German and Spanish


### Newsletter translations

Translations of the XMPP Newsletter will be released here:

## Software releases

It has been almost a year since the release of Gajim 1.1.3. A year of developing new features, cleaning up old code, and fixing bugs. This month, it is finally the time for a [first beta release of Gajim 1.2](https://gajim.org/post/2020-05-08-gajim-1.2.0-beta1-released/). Highlights are (amongst others): improved group chat system, completely rewritten network code, and a new account creation assistant. But there is much more to discover.

### Clients and applications

[Gajim Development News May 2020](https://gajim.org/post/2020-05-26-development-news-may/): New account badges and the great plugin overhaul. In preparation of the upcoming 1.2 release, many plugins have been revisited. Check out the new file preview!

Goffi released [Salut Ã  Toi progress note for calendar week 21](https://www.goffi.org/b/kmebCba3m38dr9sgzgGrkp/progress-note)!

[Poezio](https://poez.io) released 0.13.0 and 0.13.1 which now requires python 3.7. These versions bring Poezio into the club of OMEMO supporting clients and also enable HTTP upload via dedicated plugins. Check the full [changelog](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/poezio/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG) to look at all the improvements of these versions.

[Biboumi](https://biboumi.louiz.org/), the XMPP/IRC gateway, was released in version 0.8.5, fixing compilation issues with GCC 10.

The python based XMPP automatic file sender [Errol has been updated to v2.0.1](https://blog.agayon.be/errol_update1.html) which modernizes its async I/O calls and adds more privacy. By moving from 'aionotify' to the better maintained 'watchdog', Errol theoretically extends its support (from Linux only) to Windows, Mac OS X and FreeBSD.

## Services

blabber.im now [supports IPv6](https://blabber.im/blabber-im-ist-nun-ipv6-tauglich/). The service operators created an [invitation link which works for their server but also for every other ID](https://blabber.im/en/i-moved/). If you moved to an XMPP based chat client, you can now conveniently put this link into the status of your previous non-XMPP chat clients. This link offers your contacts all the necessary infos to be able to reach you and (if they want to) follow you into the XMPP world.

![Jabber.org](https://www.jabber.org/jabber.png)

jabber.org migrates its server to Prosody. [Stay informed!](https://www.jabber.org/notices.html)

yaxim.org rolled out [new anti-spam measures](https://yaxim.org/blog/2020/05/12/new-anti-spam-measures/). You may be interested in the '[The Jabber Spam Fighting Manifesto](https://github.com/JabberSPAM/jabber-spam-fighting-manifesto)', too.

## Libraries

The XMPP library for Python 3.7+, [Slixmpp](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp), was [updated to version 1.5.0](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2020-May/090424.html), with minor releases 1.5.1 and 1.5.2. The [changelog]( https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp/-/tags/slix-1.5.0) shows improvements of numerous XEPs and preliminary support for OMEMO.

Quite some time has past since the last official Smack release. Now there are some very early alpha releases of Smack 4.4.
Among additional support for more than a dozen new XEPs, the new release will contain a new architecture for modular transports, as well as a modified API that applies the builder pattern to stanza types.
A date for the final release is not yet known, but it is now time to give feedback to make sure to get your changes into the next stable Smack release!
[Read the detailed list of changes](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/wiki/Smack-4.4-Readme-and-Upgrade-Guide).
