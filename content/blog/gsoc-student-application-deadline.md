Just a reminder to folks (aka Students) that the deadline for Student Proposals is April 9th.

Please scan the list of [projects](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2010_Project_Ideas) and prepare your application submissions on the [GSoC site](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/home/google/gsoc2010).

We're looking forward to a productive summer of XMPP coding and we hope you'll be part of it.
