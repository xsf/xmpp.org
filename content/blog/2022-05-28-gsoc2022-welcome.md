The Google Summer of Code 2022 is about to lift off and coding starts soon! The XSF has not just been 
accepted (again!) as a hosting organization for XMPP projects, we also can welcome two new contributors who will work on open-source software projects in the XMPP environment! We have updated our [designated web-page](https://xmpp.org/community/gsoc-2022/) for the Google Summer of Code 2022 accordingly.

### The XMPP projects at Google Summer of Code 2022

So, please welcome **Patiga** and **PawBud** as new contributors! It is really great that you chose XMPP for your coding adventure!

- **Patiga** will work on more [flexible file transfers in Dino](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/z9ixHTWZ). Mentors will be **fiaxh** and **Marvin W.** - many thanks to both of you!
  - Resource-wise, messenger applications tend to be on the lightweight side of the spectrum. This drastically changes when file transfers are added to the equation. File transfers can arbitrarily increase resource-usage, both on network and data storage aspects. To alleviate this issue, stateless file sharing empowers the user to make informed decisions on which files to download. Deliverables:
    - Unified handling of HTTP and Jingle (peer-to-peer) file transfers
    - Enable sending metadata alongside files
    - Thumbnail previews for images
- **PawBud** will work towards adding support for [A/V communication via Jingle in ConverseJS](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/0nRwZN19). Mentors will be **JC Brand** and **vanitasvitae** - many thanks to both of you, too!
  - The idea is to add support for Audio & Video communication through the Jingle protocol. The goal is to create a Converse plugin that adds the ability to make one-on-one audio/video calls from Converse. The audio/video calls will be compatible with other XMPP clients.
