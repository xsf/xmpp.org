## Elbe-Sprint 2023: Post-Sprint Summary

In June the [Elbe-Sprint 2023](https://xmpp.org/2023/04/elbe-sprint-hamburg-2023/) took place in Hamburg and it was a great first experience after all the pandemic in the past years for many participants.
In this blog post we want to summarize progress we've made during the sprint.

First of all, many thanks to the [CCCHH](https://www.hamburg.ccc.de/) and their members for offering the opportunity and their space in Hamburg-Altona. It was a great location and it served the purpose well.

We met on Thursday night for dinner and got some delicious pizza and Italian food. We had a short welcoming round and exchange on XMPP topics followed immediately. Afterwards, we met at a [small park area](https://osm.org/go/0HoGQM9A?m=). Accidentially, there was a small festival called ["Altonale - Festival of the cultural Future"](https://www.altonale.de/altonale-festival/) and welcoming open seating options on the grass ground. As the festival title says, it was organised around discussing future topics - the perfect place to kick of the XMPP Elbe Sprint!

Then, on Friday we kicked off at 10:00 am in the morning with a short presentation of what everyone plans to work on. The developers and topics present allocated around ANIS update, [Conversations 3.0](https://conversations.im/) and [lttrs](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android), [Dino](https://dino.im/), [PGPainless](https://gh.pgpainless.org/) and [XMPP Providers](https://providers.xmpp.net/).
The night we spent at a Kurdish & Turkish restaurant at the city and finished nearby the river Elbe enjoying the scenery.

Moving on after a first good day we continued working on Saturday. After the lunch break we had three presentations: One on ANIS update, then an XMPP introduction talk so anyone who is interested can join and ask about it, and finally a status update on PGPainless. The night we spent in an Indian restaurant in the famous St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg as a little highlight. As in many other countries, the idea of sharing the food served seemed to be the best choice for the knowledge, the XMPP protocol and the technology we are developing and last but not least how we work together.

After the final dinner, we went out for a walk and took a boat drive along the river Elbe and watched the sunset and scenery together. We finished with another round of drinks at the Festival where we started:

How do we want to build our (communication) future?

At Sunday we concluded the Elbe-Sprint after a pre-lunch working phase and a small closing ceremony where everybody summarized what they have been working on and what they achieved during the sprint.

As you read, we were not only focusing on work, we also spent a decent amount of time doing social events and personal exchange on XMPP but also many things of life around. That is what many seem to enjoy a lot during sprints, too.

See you at the next sprint hopefully,
