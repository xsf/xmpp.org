## Elbe-Sprint 2023: Post-Sprint Summary

In June the [Elbe-Sprint 2023](https://xmpp.org/2023/04/elbe-sprint-hamburg-2023/) took place in Hamburg and it was for many a great first experience after all the pandemic in the past years. 
In this blogpost we want to summarize a bit on the work we have been progressing.

First of all, many thanks to the [CCCHH](https://www.hamburg.ccc.de/) and their members for offering the opportunity and their space in Hamburg-Altona. It was 
a good locations and it served the purpose well.

We met on Thursday night for dinner and got some delicious pizza and Italian food. We had a short welcoming round and exchange on XMPP topics followed immediately. Afterwards, 
we me at a [small park area](https://osm.org/go/0HoGQM9A?m=). Accidentially, there was a small festival called ["Altonale - Festival of the cultural Future"](https://www.altonale.de/altonale-festival/) 
the and welcoming open seating options on the grass ground. As the festival title says, it was organised around discussing future topics - the perfect place to kick of the XMPP Elbe Sprint!

Then, on Friday we kicked off at 10:00 am in the morning with a short presentation of what everyone plans to work on. The developers and topics present allocated around ANIS update, 
[Conversations 3.0](https://conversations.im/) and [lttrs](https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android), [Dino](https://dino.im/), [PGPainless](https://gh.pgpainless.org/) and [XMPP Providers](https://providers.xmpp.net/). 
The night we spent at a kurdish & turkish restaurant at the city and finished nearby the river Elbe enjoying the scenery.

Moving on after a first good day we continued working on Saturday. After the lunch break we had three presentations: One on ANIS update, an XMPP introduction talk so anyone who's is interested can 
join and ask about it and a status update on PGPpainless. The night we spent as a little highlight in an India restaurant in the famous St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg. As in many other countries, the idea
of sharing the food served seemed to be the best choice for the protocol and technology we are developing and last but not least how we work together. After the final dinner, we went out for a walk and took a boat drive
along the river Elbe and watched the sunset and scenery all together. We finished with another round of drinks at the Festival where we started: How do we want to build our (communcation) future?

At Sunday concluded the Elbe-Sprint on Sunday after a pre-lunch working phase and a small closing ceremony on summarizing what everyone has been working on and achieved.

As you read, we were not only focusing on working, we also spent a decent amount of time doing social events and personal exchange on XMPP but also many things of life around. That is
what many seem enjoy a lot during sprint, too.

See you hopefully at the next sprint,
Eddie â€” The organizer
