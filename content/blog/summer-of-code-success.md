Although the [Google Summer of Code](/2007/04/summer-of-code-projects) ended weeks ago, we neglected to post a final summary. 

All of the XMPP-related projects ended successfully and all of our students continue to contribute to the community. You can download their code [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2007-xmpp/downloads/list) and you can view final project reports from our students at the following links:
