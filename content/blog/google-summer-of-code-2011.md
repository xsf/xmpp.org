The [XSF](https://xmpp.org/) will be applying this year to participate in Google's [Summer of Code 2011](http://code.google.com/soc/) and we need the help of XMPP project members in getting a   list of summer project ideas together!

So, if you're an XMPP project and would like to participate in GSoC under the XSF's umbrella, please visit the [Summer of Code 2011](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2011) wiki page and start adding ideas of projects you would like to mentor.

If you're a user of XMPP projects, and have great ideas, please get in contact with the projects and get them excited and involved in the   process too.

Let's get together a list of summer projects that will excite and attract new long-term developers to the protocol we know and love, and hope that Google approve our application again!

Once we've got a list of ideas in, we'll vet them and produce a list of proposals for students interested in the XSF.
