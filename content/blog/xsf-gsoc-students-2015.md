This year, we've been lucky enough to have had many great applications to take part in Google Summer of Code under the XSF. We've selected the following six students/projects and are looking forward to working with them over an exciting summer:

- *Tarun Gupta*: [Extend Stroke Implementation](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/tarun018/5741031244955648)
- *Daniel Baczynski*: [Multi-account support in Swift](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/matrix4/5724160613416960)
- *Ishan Khanna*: [Add support for XMPP Serverless Messaging (XEP-174) to Smack](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/ishan1604/5697982787747840)
- *Marvin W*: [Add support for DNSSEC to Smack via MiniDNS](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/larma/5643440998055936)

This should be a great summer for the students, and for all the projects involved.
