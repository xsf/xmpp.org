The German initiative 'Digital Independence Day' ([DI.DAY](https://di.day/)) has been kicked off this year to enable users to migrate to open-source software alternatives in various contexts.
Besides other services, XMPP is listed as an [alternative chat option](https://di.day/whats-app-zu-signal/) and XMPP Community members have created so-called switch recipes on their own: [Digital Independence Day](https://imday.de/en/).

This initiative shares many values of the XMPP community, such as digital sovereignty and digital privacy.
If you are interested: please find their resources linked.
The DI.DAY is not a single event, it takes place every [first sunday of the month](https://termine.di.day/) so interested users can switch one service at a time.

Many thanks to the XMPP Community members and beyond for investing their efforts to provide all material, namely Axel, Daniel, emus, Ge0rG, padeluun and especially *IM* from [freie-messenger.de](https://www.freie-messenger.de/)!
Additional thanks to [Digitalcourage](https://digitalcourage.de/en) and [Save Social](https://savesocial.eu/en/) for sponsoring the handouts for [FOSDEM](https://xmpp.org/2026/01/xmpp-at-fosdem-2026-update/)!

Find many other chat apps at [xmpp.org](https://xmpp.org/software/?category=clients)!

See you [online via XMPP](https://xmpp.org/community/chat/) and open-source software!
