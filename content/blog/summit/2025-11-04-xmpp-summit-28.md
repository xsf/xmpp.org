The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) is exited to announce the 28th XMPP Summit taking place in Brussels, Belgium next year - just before [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/).
The XSF invites everyone interested in development of the XMPP protocol to attend, and discuss all things XMPP - both in person and remotely!

## The XMPP Summit

The XMPP Summit is a two-day event for the people who write and implement [XMPP extensions (XEPs)](https://xmpp.org/extensions/).
The event is not a typical conference - aside from small and short lightning talks, there are no long presentations.

### Who participates at the Summit?

The participants, where everyone is welcome, are sitting at a round table to discuss and active participation is encouraged.
Similar to an _unconference_ at the beginning all participants can suggest topics and others can indicate via votes whether or not they are interested in that topic.

Afterwards a rough order of topics is established that will be followed in moderation with the participants.

### How does the Summit work?

If you have ever followed a thread on the [standards mailing list](https://xmpp.org/community/mailing-lists/) or taken part in a discussion on the [public XSF channel](https://xmpp.org/community/chat/) you should be familiar with this - just in person.
The different topics are broken up by short breaks that are great for networking and getting to know other XMPP developers.
Still, if you cannot participate, we will also provide an online way of joining the discussion.

Agreeing on a common strategy or even establishing a rough priority for certain features in our decentral and interoperable technology and protocol can be hard.
In-person events do a lot in getting us on the same page and as an XMPP developer (e.g. client, server, gateway) we strongly encourage you to come to the summit.
_(In short: To get the most out of the summit you should have a background in reading (and maybe even writing) XEPs)._

If you are simply an enthusiastic user or admin we regularly have booths at various conferences (FOSDEM, CLT, FrOSCon, …) that are a great opportunity to meet us, too.
Either way, everyone is welcome to participate!

If we've caught your attention, we will then hopefully see you at the XMPP Summit 28. Read on!
