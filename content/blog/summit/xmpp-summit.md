We've decided to hold the next XMPP Summit in Portland, Oregon at the end of October. Mark your calendars for October 25th, which is the day after the [Keeping it Realtime conference](http://2012.krtconf.com/). Co-locating the XMPP Summit with krtconf makes a lot of sense, since both events are focused on building real-time applications.

Many details are yet to be worked out (e.g., we might hold a two-day Summit instead of a one-day Summit), but we will post again in a few weeks once we know more.

Please note that krtconf is a small, high-caliber conference and will sell out quickly, so make sure to get on their email list and register early before all their tickets are sold out (and think about [giving a talk](http://blog.krtconf.com/post/24012727201/krtconf-2012-call-for-speakers) at krtconf, too!).
