In a bit more than two weeks (!) the tenth [XMPP Summit](https://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) to be held by the XMPP Standards Foundation will happen. February 4-7, 2011, in Brussels, Belgium (the same weekend as [FOSDEM 2011](http://www.fosdem.org/)).

The space available for the Summit itself has already reached the room capacity for the Feb 7th Summit day and there are only a handful of slots available for the Feb 4th Hackfest! Sponsors are still being sought for the XSF Dinner and I'm hearing talk that details of the Dev Challenge will be known very soon!

Please do visit the [XMPP Summit wiki page](https://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) for a detailed breakdown of the schedule and also to register/sign up for any of the events.

The Summit promises to be an exciting mix of tech, geekery and an awesome display of protocol nerdness!
