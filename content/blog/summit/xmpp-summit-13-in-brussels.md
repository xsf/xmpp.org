This is just a quick note to inform you that the XSF will hold its 13th XMPP Summit in Brussels, Belgium on January 31 and February 1, 2013. This is Thursday and Friday before FOSDEM 2013. Details are on the wiki at http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit\_13 and join the summit@xmpp.org list to discuss.

edit: hmm, did I just edit this so it would reappear in folks feed readers... why yes, yes I did ;)
