The XMPP Standards Foundation held its third developer conference on July 23 and 24, 2007, in Portland, Oregon, USA (the same week as [OSCON 2007](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/)).

### Why Attend?
XMPP Summit 3 is the best place for developers to get a jumpstart on the upcoming 2008 certification program and to discuss cutting-edge topics in the XMPP community.

### Discussion Topics
In general the discussion will focus on solving problems related to important XMPP protocol extensions and brainstorming new XMPP applications (including integration with existing applications such as content management and social networking).

Potential topics include:

-   Details on the 2008 certification program
-   Personal Eventing via Pubsub (PEP)
-   End-to-end encryption via ESessions
-   Jingle for voice and beyond
-   Preventing the emergence of spim on the Jabber network
-   Encouraging deployment of TLS on the Jabber network via use of the XMPP ICA
-   Improvement of the [interop testing network](https://xmpp.org/interop/)
-   Final clarifications to rfc3920bis and rfc3921bis
