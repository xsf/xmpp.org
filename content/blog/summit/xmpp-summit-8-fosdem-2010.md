Once again the XSF will be combining one of our Summit meetings with attendance at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/) in Brussels on the weekend of 6/7 February 2010.

We'll have a devroom for half a day at FOSDEM (as we did last year - [see here for some blog posts](http://blog.xmpp.org/index.php/category/fosdem-2009/%20)) and run the Summit around the FOSDEM weekend in a nearby Hotel. The current plan is to again hold a "hackfest" on Friday, have a free day at FOSDEM on Sunday, and then hold the official Summit on Monday.

If you're thinking of attending the Summit and/or FOSDEM, please mark this long-weekend in your diary. We will post further information as it become available.
