We're very excited to announce our presence at the coming [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org)!

Once again, many members of the XMPP community will be attending, and we hope to see you there!

## Realtime Lounge

As usual, we will have the *Realtime Lounge* set up, where you can come and meet community members, project developers, see demos and ask us questions.

This year we will be at the regular place on the [K building's 2nd floor](https://fosdem.org/2026/stands/).

## XMPP Summit 28 prio to FOSDEM 2026

Prio to FOSDEM, the XSF will also traditionally hold its [28th XMPP summit](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_25).
This is where community members gather to discuss protocol changes and the XMPP roadmap.
Everyone is welcome to join, just kindly list yourself free of cost as we have limited space.
