Today we advanced [XEP-0174: Link-Local Messaging](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html) to Draft in our standards process. This specification defines how to send XMPP messages in a serverless mode via zero-configuration networking (a technology created by Apple Computer, originally called Rendezvous and now called Bonjour). 

As [previously mentioned](/2007/03/last-call-link-local-messaging), we issued a Last Call for comments on this specification on March 1. Feedback came in from a number of developers, resulting in some corrections late in the process, thus the delay in publication. But the spec is stronger for the feedback and we're looking forward to seeing implementations in more Jabber clients (e.g., there is a Google Summer of Code project to improve the link-local messaging support in the Adium client for Mac OS X).

Thanks to everyone who provided comments on this spec!
