The [XMPP assembly](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/hub/en/assembly/detail/xmpp) for the Chaos Communication Congress 39C3 has been confirmed!

The Chaos Communication Congress is a hacker conference that takes place every year barring specific world-ending events, and in which more than 10 000 hackers come together in Hamburg (previously Leipzig and Berlin).

We will have a space inside the [Critical Decentralization Cluster](https://decentral.community/39C3/) habitat this year, which will provide a friendly space for discussions and exchanges on technology and politics with other communities working towards decentralization.

We will also come with a bunch of sparkly XMPP stickers that look like this:

If someone plans to stay a while at the assembly, please make sure to register with the assembly on your ticket, as described in the [info pages](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/assemblies.html#seat-allocation-and-assignment), so that we have enough room for everyone.
You can join the [XMPP chatroom](xmpp:39c3@chat.jabberfr.org?join) ([web](https://chat.jabberfr.org/converse.js/39c3@chat.jabberfr.org)) as well as support organisation via the related [XMPP Wiki page](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/39C3).
