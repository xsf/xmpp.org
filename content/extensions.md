The core specifications for XMPP are developed at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - see [RFC 6120](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6120/), [RFC 7590](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7590/), [RFC 6121](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6121/), and [RFC 7622](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7622/) (along with a WebSocket binding defined in [RFC 7395](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7395/)).

The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its XEP series. This page lists Draft and Final XEPs as well as experimental proposals that are currently under consideration.

Good places for developers to start are the [compliance suites](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html), as well as the [technology overview pages](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/).
