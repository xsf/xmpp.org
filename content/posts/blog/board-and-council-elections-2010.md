In accordance with the [XSF Bylaws](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-bylaws/), once a year the XMPP Standards Foundation holds elections for its [Board of Directors](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/the-xsf-board-of-directors/) and for the [XMPP Council](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/the-xsf-council/). Elections for the 2010-2011 Board and Council will be held on October 25, 2010 (with proxy voting 1 Oct. - 24 Oct.).

If you are interested in running for Board or Council, please add a wiki page about your candidacy to the relevant sections of [this page on the XMPP Wiki](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2010) by the close of business on September 30, 2010.

*Note*: XMPP Council members must be *[elected members](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/xsf-member-list/)* of the XSF; however, there is no such restriction for the Board of Directors.
