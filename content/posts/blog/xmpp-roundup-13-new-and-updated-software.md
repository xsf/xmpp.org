Welcome to the XMPP software Roundup 13. As announced in the [latest Roundup](http://blog.xmpp.org/index.php/2010/01/xmpp-roundup-13-articles-talks-and-events/), we have split it into different parts. The first part covered articles, talks and events. This post covers new and updated software, the next one will cover XMPP services.

Special thanks to Will, Waqas, Jack, Guillaume, Nicolas, who have actively contributed to this report.

Due to the high number of new items (yes, the XMPP community is super-active), we have sectionned these into the classical division clients, servers, and libraries, and... a last section you should check carefully.
