**Is There a New Successor to SIP?**

Is XMPP is set to overthrow SIP as the VoIP signaling king? [Tsahi Levent-Levi, a system architect at RADVISION](http://blog.radvision.com/voipsurvivor/2008/11/27/is-there-a-new-successor-to-sip/), thinks it's a possibility.

**Codebits 2008 **

[XSF Member Pedro Melo has posted the content of his "XMPP - Hands On"](http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/archives/2008/11/codebits_2008_x.html%20) presentation at Codebits 2008 (a Portuguese event hosted by Portuguese Telecoms company [Sapo.pt](http://www.sapo.pt/) ). The presentation itself is in Portuguese, the code accompanying it is, obviously, not :-)

**XMPP & Groupware**

Another XSF Member, [Nicolas Vérité, alerts us to a piece of XMPP groupware news](http://nyco.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/jabberxmpp-dans-les-groupwares-obm-et-zimbra/) -  that Thomas Cataldo has integrated XMPP instant messaging into MiniG, a webmail client for the OBM groupware solution ([there's a short video demo on Thomas' blog](http://tcataldo.blogspot.com/)). and notes that [Zimbra](http://www.zimbra.com/), another groupware product also integrates Openfire.

**Cloud Standardization: Unified Cloud Interface (UCI)**

XMPP as a unified cloud interface component? Reuvan Cohen, of [Enomaly](http://www.enomaly.com/), [talks enthusiastically about implementing the Unified Cloud Interface (UCI) as a XEP](http://www.elasticvapor.com/2008/11/cloud-standardization-unified-cloud.html). Reuvan doesn't appear to be on the XSF members list, perhaps he should be?
