The XSF has issued a Last Call on [XEP-0262](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0266.html), which describes implementation considerations related to audio codecs for use in Jingle RTP sessions, and recommends PCMU and PCMA (G.711) as mandatory-to-implement technologies to provide a baseline for interoperability.

If you have feedback, please post to the [jingle@xmpp.org](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/jingle) or [standards@xmpp.org](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) discussion list before July 8, 2011.
