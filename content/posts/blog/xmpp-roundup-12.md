[Reporter: Nicolas Vérité, assisted by Peter Saint-Andre]
This Roundup is the third "almost-monthly" review of the XMPP-sphere this summer. It shows again a lot of activity as you can see through these pointers to articles, software, services, and of course specifications, the core of our work here at the XSF.

**Articles**

*XMPP web project walk-through*  

Boris Okner describes a weather [web application using ejabberd and strophe](http://rfid-ale.blogspot.com/2009/08/xmpp-web-project-walkthrough.html) over BOSH. You can [play with the demo](http://weazard.chirpber.com:8000/weazard.html) (username: shared, password: shared).

*Scalable XMPP bots with erlang and exmpp*  

ProcessOne has published a series of articles on how to build bots on top of the exmpp library (in Erlang). These come in three parts: [part I](http://www.process-one.net/en/blogs/article/scalable_xmpp_bots_with_erlang_and_exmpp_part_i/), [part II](http://www.process-one.net/en/blogs/article/scalable_xmpp_bots_with_erlang_and_exmpp_part_ii/) and [part III](http://www.process-one.net/en/blogs/article/scalable_xmpp_bots_with_erlang_and_exmpp_part_iii/).

*Meet the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)*  

IBM developerWorks has published [an article by Tim Jones introducing XMPP as a multipurpose instant messaging architecture](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-xmppintro/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX06&S_CMP=EDU) that is not only suited for chat applications. There is an example in Ruby using the xmpp4r library.

*XMPP powering the “internet of things”?*  

A few "internet of things" (or "IoT") projects are using [XMPP as a communication layer](http://www.process-one.net/en/blogs/article/xmpp_powering_the_internet_of_things/): this could well show an area of development for XMPP.

**New and updated software**

*Psi 0.13*  

The verson 0.13 of Psi, the well-known free software Jabber client, has been [released by Justin Karneges on the 28th of July](http://lists.affinix.com/pipermail/psi-devel-affinix.com/2009-July/008770.html). Sorry for that miss on the previous Roundup. The main new feature a top-requested one: Jingle voice! A few days later, Justin announced the [0.14 plan](http://lists.affinix.com/pipermail/psi-devel-affinix.com/2009-August/008797.html), you can read the interesting follow-up.

*Pidgin 2.6*  

In yet another big advance for Jingle, the Pidgin team has released the version 2.6 of this multi-protocol IM client, with [Jingle voice and video](http://theflamingbanker.blogspot.com/2009/08/pidgin-260-its-about-time.html) for Linux and Mac OS X. Support for Jingle file transfer is also on the way.

You can read this in a mention on this [blog post](http://www.clochix.net/post/2009/08/30/Nouveau-fan-des-Sixties) in French.

*XMPP on Google App Engine*  

Google has released the version 1.2.5 of their Java and Python SDK for the App Engine (or GAE), [including](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/09/app-engine-sdk-125-released-for-python.html) in fact [most current XMPP features](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/09/app-engine-sdk-125-released-for-python.html).

**New and updated services**

*Data synchro from Google*  

Google has announced that [data synchronization from the browser is done through XMPP](http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/08/google-reveals-plans-for-chrome-cloud-synchronization.ars) in their Chrome browser. Opera Link and Mozilla Weave provide the same feature, but do not rely on XMPP (yet!).

*Switchub*  

[Switchub](http://switchub.com/) is a service for push notifications, using web hooks and XMPP. For now it is only available on invite.

*Dispatch.io*  

[Dispatch.io](http://www.dispatch.io/) is a notification service for Growl using XMPP.

*PubSubHubbub to XMPP gateway*  

Matt Mastracci has released a [PubSubHubbub to XMPP gateway](http://grack.com/blog/2009/09/09/pubsubhubbub-to-xmpp-gateway/) on [appspot](http://pubsubhubbub-xmpp.appspot.com/).

*Mumbai Blood Bank Locator Agent*

**New and updated specs**

*XMPP Relay Nodes*  

[XMPP relay nodes](http://xmppjingle.blogspot.com/2009/07/jingle-relay-nodes-full-description.html) are a technology that grew out of discussions at the XMPP Summit in Brussels earlier this year. They are much like supernodes in Skype, but slightly better: any XMPP client can become a relay peer for the rest of a P2P Jingle network, typically on an opt-in basis (e.g., anyone in your buddy list can borrow some of your bandwidth). This has not been proposed as an official XSF "XEP" yet.

*Linked Process*  

[Linked Process](http://linkedprocess.org/) is a specification and an implementation aiming at machine communication. It will probably be proposed as an official XEP soon.

*XMPP for cloud computing in bioinformatics*  

[XMPP for cloud computing in bioinformatics](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/279/abstract).

The XMPP community has also worked hard on the following specs recently:

-   Over at the IETF's [XMPP Working Group](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/xmpp/), version 02 of [draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-xmpp-3920bis) has been released, including an updated description of the [ACTive architecture](https://stpeter.im/index.php/2009/09/01/active-architectures/) used in XMPP.
-   The [XMPP Council](http://xmpp.org/council/) has advanced both [XEP-0202: Entity Time](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0202.html) and [XEP-0203 (Delayed Delivery)](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0203.html) from Draft to Final in the XSF's standards process.
-   There are Last Calls in progress on [XEP-0227: Portable Import/Export Format for XMPP-IM Servers](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0227.html), [XEP-0244: IO Data](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0244.html), and [XEP-0270: XMPP Compliance Suites 2010](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0270.html).
-   The XMPP Council has approved some small "maintenance" fixes to [XEP-0080: User Location](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0080.html), [XEP-0256: Last Activity in Presence](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0256.html), [XEP-0055: Jabber Search](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0055.html), [XEP-0077: In-Band Registration](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0077.html) (with some fixes to [XEP-0085: Chat State Notifications](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0085.html) and [XEP-0136: Message Archiving](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html) on the way).
-   Three new Experimental specifications have been published: [XEP-0272: Multiparty Jingle (Muji)](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0272.html), [XEP-0273 Stanza Interception and Filtering Technology (SIFT)](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0273.html), and [XEP-0274: Design Considerations for Digital Signatures in XMPP](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0274.html).

**Conclusion**

It has been a busy summer for XMPP:

-   With so much happening, it becomes difficult to keep track of XMPP-related news! If you would like to help, please ping me at nyco@jabber.fr or join the [jabber@conference.jabber.org](xmpp:jabber@conference.jabber.org?join) chatroom (you can even join it via the web [here](http://speeqe.com/room/jabber@conference.jabber.org/)).
-   XMPP is becoming more and more ubiquitous. It seems that developers everywhere appreciate many of its features and qualities, like openness, presence and IM, federation, push, request-response messaging, and so on...
