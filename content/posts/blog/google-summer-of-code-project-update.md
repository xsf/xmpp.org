As of 1900 UTC Monday, Google has published the list of accepted project for the Google Summer of Code and I'm very happy to report that four of the proposals to the XSF were accepted!

Congratulations to Nicolas, Tobias, Zhenchao and Zhiwei for braving the process and getting accepted!

Now the real work starts ;)Â  -- a great article to read is from the [GSoCMentoring series](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCMentoring/MindtheGap)

I'm looking forward to working with them and their mentors in making this a great Summer of Code!
