The fourth developer conference held by the XMPP Standards Foundation occurred on February 24 and 25, 2008, in Brussels, Belgium (the same week as [FOSDEM 2008](http://www.fosdem.org/)).

The following information was archived from [http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/FOSDEM\_2008](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/FOSDEM_2008).

### Intro
The 2008 edition of FOSDEM (the [Free and Open source Software Developers' Europe Meeting](http://www.fosdem.org/)) will take place at the ULB, Brussels, Belgium over the weekend of February 23-24 2008.

Here is the plan for the Jabber/XMPP community...

We don't have a FOSDEM "devroom" this year so we will focus on a booth at FOSDEM on Saturday. Jabberites will also be encouraged to attend various FOSDEM talks on Saturday.

On Sunday and Monday we will hold a "devcon" at the Atlas Hotel in Brussels. Join the [devcon list](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/devcon) to discuss.

If you want to help out with the booth or attend the devcon, leave your name below. If you do not have an account at this wiki, contact [Alexander Gnauck](xmpp:gnauck@jabber.org) and he will create an account for you.

### Booth
The booth is a great way to talk to people interested in our technologies. If you are interested in manning the booth (if only for a few hours), contact [Ralph Meijer](xmpp:ralphm@ik.nu "xmpp:ralphm@ik.nu").

### Devcon Agenda
Here is a preliminary agenda, as posted by stpeter on the devcon list...

    Sunday, February 24, 2008
    09:30 - 10:00 Introductions / Agenda Bashing
    10:00 - 10:30 The State of the Bulb (Peter Saint-Andre)
    10:30 - 11:00 Deployment Challenges (Florian Jensen)
    11:00 - 11:30 Abuse Reporting / Spam Prevention (Peter Saint-Andre)
    12:00 - 14:00 "Working" Lunch
    14:00 - 14:30 Lunchtable Reports
    14:30 - 16:00 Mobile XMPP Roundtable
    16:00 - 17:00 Open Topics / Lightning Talks
    17:00 - 19:00 Break
    19:00 - 22:00 XSF Dinner

    Monday, February 25, 2008
    09:30 - 11:00 Jingle Roundtable
    11:00 - 11:30 File Transfer (Peter Saint-Andre)
    11:30 - 12:00 XML Synchronization (Fabio Forno et al.)
    12:00 - 14:00 "Working" Lunch
    14:00 - 14:30 Lunchtable Reports
    14:30 - 15:00 Summary / Action Items
    15:00 - 16:00 XMPP Council Meeting

This agenda attempts to be realistic about start times given pub "meetings" the night before, how long it takes to go out to lunch, etc. Last year we had informal breakout discussions at the lunch tables and this year we'd like to formalize that a bit by suggesting some topics for discussion and then receiving lunchtable reports when we return to the meeting room (sometimes the most creative solutions are developed over meals or a mug of beer).

### Other Events
On the evening of Friday February 22 we will join the world-famous FOSDEM Beer Event -- don't miss out on that!
We will also hold a dinner on Sunday, February 24 for devcon participants.

### Communications
Join the [devcon-discuss list](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/devcon) for more frequent updates.

### Accommodation
We will stay at the [Atlas Hotel](http://www.atlas-hotel.be/). It's located at Rue du Vieux Marché aux Grains 30 (or 'Oude Graanmarkt 30' for the Dutch-speaking part of the country) in Brussels close to the city center. TomTom doesn't seem to know the hotel by name, so you're better off using the street address for it. A map of the area around the hotel can be seen at [http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.85006&lon=4.34652&zoom=17&layers=B0FT](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.85006&lon=4.34652&zoom=17&layers=B0FT). The beer event is held at the Delirium Bar. A map of the area can be seen at[http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.848541&lon=4.354157&zoom=18&layers=B0FT](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.848541&lon=4.354157&zoom=18&layers=B0FT). It isn't named on the map, but it's the dead-end street smack in the middle of the map.

The XMPP Standards Foundation will pay the hotel costs of any XSF member who participates in the devcon. The XSF may ask that you share a room with another XSF member, but we will pay for up to four nights' stay at the Atlas hotel.
