Today the [XMPP Council](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/xsf/xmpp-council/) advanced [XEP-0288](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0288.html) from Experimental to Draft in the XSF's standards process. This specification decreases the number of sockets necessary for server-to-server connections and also removes some of the practical barriers to connection multiplexing in the Server Dialback protocol.
