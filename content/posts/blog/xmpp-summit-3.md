### Why Attend?
XMPP Summit 3 is the best place for developers to get a jumpstart on the upcoming 2008 certification program and to discuss cutting-edge topics in the XMPP community.

Potential topics include:

-   Personal Eventing via Pubsub (PEP)
-   End-to-end encryption via ESessions
-   Jingle for voice and beyond
-   Preventing the emergence of spim on the Jabber network
-   Encouraging deployment of TLS on the Jabber network via use of the XMPP ICA
-   Improvement of the [interop testing network](https://xmpp.org/interop/)
-   Final clarifications to rfc3920bis and rfc3921bis
