Each year the members of the XSF choose new people to provide technical leadership on the [XMPP Council](http://xmpp.org/about/xsf/xmpp-council/) and business leadership on the [XSF Board of Directors](http://xmpp.org/about/xsf/the-xsf-board-of-directors/). These roles typically require only a few hours a week over the one-year term, and are a great way to get involved in the XMPP community.

If you're interested in volunteering or know someone else who might be, visit the [wiki page](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2011) or ask one of the current [Board](http://xmpp.org/about/xsf/the-xsf-board-of-directors/) or [Council](http://xmpp.org/about/xsf/xmpp-council/) members for insights.
