Six days (!) until the tenth [XMPP Summit](http://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) to be held by the XMPP Standards Foundation will happen.

Yes, in less than a week, a collection of XMPP devs and geeks will swarm the [FOSDEM 2011 conference](http://www.fosdem.org/) (February 4-7, 2011, in Brussels, Belgium) and dazzle folks with how distributed systems are supposed to work.

Please do visit the [XMPP Summit wiki page](http://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/) for a detailed breakdown of the schedule and also to register/sign up for any of the events.
