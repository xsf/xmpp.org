As before, the [XSF](http://xmpp.org/) has applied to this year's [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). 

The XSF is intending to act as an umbrella organisation for any XMPP-related project that wishes to join the GSoC. If you are a member of such a project and would like your project to be involved, get in touch!

[A fresh page of project ideas](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2017) has been created on the XSF wiki. If you'd like to mentor for your project, please get in touch with us in the [XSF GSoC MUC Room](xmpp:gsoc@muc.xmpp.org?join).
