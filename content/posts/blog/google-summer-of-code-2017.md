As before, the [XSF](http://xmpp.org/) will apply to this years [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). 

The XSF is intending to act as an umbrella organisation for any XMPP-related project that wishes to join the GSoC. If you are a member of such a project and would like your project to be involved, get in touch!

A fresh page of project ideas has been created on the XSF wiki. If you're interested in mentoring this year, please have a look at [Summer of Code 2017](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2017) and add your ideas there.
