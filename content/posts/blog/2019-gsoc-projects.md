The XMPP Standards Foundation is happy to act as umbrella organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019. This year we are glad to mentor and support the following three GSoC projects.

Prosody plugin installer
========================

**Student:** João Duarte
**GSoC Blog:** https://gsoc-prosody-2019.blogspot.com
**Project:** [Prosody](https://prosody.im) - An XMPP server written in Lua
**Mentors:** MattJ, Zash

João lives in Portugal and usually studies Aerospace Engineering. This summer he will be developing an integration between Prosody and the LuaRocks package manager and ecosystem,allowing installation and management of third-party Prosody modules via simple commands.

Poezio infinite scrolling using MAM
===================================

**Student:** Madhur Garg
**GSoC Blog:** https://madhur96.github.io/gsoc19/
**Project:** [Poezio](https://poez.io) - A free console XMPP client in Python
**Mentors:** pep, Link Mauve

Madhur is a student of the International Institute of Information Technology in Hyderabad, India. He likes Python and C++. Outside of programming, he likes guitar and trekking.
This summer he will be working on adding “Infinite scroll” support to poezio, the console client, using [XEP-0313: Message Archive Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html), as well as some other general improvements.


Jingle File Transfer for Dino
=============================

**Student:** hrxi
**GSoC Blog:** https://hrxi.github.io/gsoc/
**Project:** [Dino](https://dino.im) - A modern open-source chat client for the desktop in Vala
**Mentors:** fixah, la|r|ma

hrxi will implement encrypted peer-to-peer Jingle file transfers in Dino. The encrypted connection will be set up by either one of the supported encryption protocols of Dino, OMEMO and OpenPGP. In order to achieve compatibility with web clients, it is planned to support WebRTC as a transport protocol. The implementation will be done in a way that allows building support for audio/video chat on top of it. hrxi is based in Germany, studies mathematics and computer science, and likes to write code in Rust.
