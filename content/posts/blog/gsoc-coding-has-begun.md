Our [Google Summer of Code students](/2012/04/and-our-gsoc-students-are/) are merrily coding away now.

Short descriptions of their projects can be found at [google-melange.com](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/xsf), but for all the latest updates be sure to check out their blog posts, which are aggregated at [planet.jabber.org](http://planet.jabber.org/).

They make for fun reading!
