The Mentor's and Students have all been working hard with their projects and they have reached an important milestone: the mid-term evaluations!Â  As of a couple hours ago all of our evaluations have been submitted and they are ready to continue on towards the last half of the project.

If you are interested in following along, you can see project updates as posted by each student in their respective blogs:

- [Zhiwei Dai's Server-side Archiving for Prosody](http://gsoc-prosody.blogspot.com/)
- [Tobias Markmann's Chat/MUC Reliability and Improvements](http://ayena.de/)

Good progress has been made and I am looking forward to seeing what they produce at the end of the GSoC session!
