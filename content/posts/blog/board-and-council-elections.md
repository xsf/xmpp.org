Once a year, the XMPP Standards Foundation holds elections for its [Board of Directors](http://xmpp.org/xsf/board/) and for the [XMPP Council](http://xmpp.org/council/). That time is now, so the XSF is actively soliciting people to stand for election. Here is the division of responsibilities between the two groups:

1. The Board provides business leadership for the XSF by handling things like fundraising, contracts, grants, legal issues, planning the [XMPP Summit](http://xmpp.org/summit/) meetings, and choosing volunteers for various official posts such as the Secretary and Executive Director. Those who serve on the Board are **not** required to be [elected members](http://xmpp.org/xsf/members/) of the XSF.

2.  The Council provides technical leadership for the XSF by managing the XSF's [standards process](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), deciding which [proposals](http://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/) to accept as [official XEPs](http://xmpp.org/extensions/), voting on advancement of XEPs through the process from Experimental to Draft to Final, and providing oversight for the functions of the [XMPP Extensions Editor](http://xmpp.org/extensions/editor.shtml) and the [XMPP Registrar](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0053.html). Those who serve on the XMPP Council are required to be elected members of the XSF.

If you are interested in standing for election, please visit [http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board\_and\_Council\_Elections\_2009](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Board_and_Council_Elections_2009) and create a page about your candidacy by the close of business on Friday, September 11, 2009.
