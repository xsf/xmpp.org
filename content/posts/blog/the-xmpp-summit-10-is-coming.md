Hey, the 10th XMPP Summit is coming up quickly, so we're preparing the participant lists so that we know for how many people we need to book venues etc.

So it would be great if you're joining us for the Summit 10 in Brussels this year, if you could leave a comment on the XMPP.org page or just say hi on the Summit list.: [XMPP Summit 10 Page](http://xmpp.org/participate/the-xmpp-summit/xmpp-summit-10/)   That page will also list all the information you'll need to know about this years Summit (some parts are still work in progress :) ).

If you're interested in holding a talk at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/2011/) in the XMPP Devroom, or are willing to help out at the XMPP Booth, check the Wiki for more information: [Link](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/FOSDEM_2011)

Hope to see you all there!

Greets,
Florian
