### Clients and applications

The multi-platform desktop client [Gajim 1.2.2 has been released](https://gajim.org/post/2020-08-15-gajim-1.2.2-released/). This release brings an automatic weekly update check for Gajim on Windows/MacOS, a big status message overhaul, and many improvements.  
[More development news from August](https://gajim.org/post/2020-08-30-development-news-august/): The settings backend received an upgrade to migrate from text files to SQLite based storage, and a lot of code has been cleaned up, which should make it easier for you to handle all of Gajim’s configuration possiblities.

The iOS and macOS client Monal is organizing translations for the app on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/monal/) now. 27 languages are waiting for excellent and native speakers! Please also check out the current [Monal Beta 4.7.0](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/releases/tag/Build_iOS_636) and get ready for the next upcoming release!

Read about the [Tigase XMPP Server as docker image](https://tigase.net/tigase-meets-docker/).

The Android client aTalk 2.4.0 has been released. [Changes](https://github.com/cmeng-git/atalk-android/blob/master/aTalk/ReleaseNotes.txt) are mainly internal with several libraries upgrades and compilation fixes. It was followed by version 2.4.1 which fixes an Android Q specific storage issue.

The desktop client [Dino received a NGI0 PET Fund](https://dino.im/blog/2020/08/setting-out-for-calls-and-conferences/) which is is managed by NLnet which further receives financial support from European Commission’s Next Generation Internet programme. This allows the developer to implement video and audio calls into their clients. This is really great news!

[Kaidan 0.6.0 has been released](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/08/20/kaidan-0.6.0/)! The update includes a new offline message queue as well as an improved message correction. There is upstream HTTP file upload implementation now and also further refactoring.

## Libraries

The modular XMPP client library Smack has [had its first beta release](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-0-beta1-released/88519) for the upcoming release of Smack version 4.4! The [list of changes](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/wiki/Smack-4.4-Readme-and-Upgrade-Guide) ranges from a new modular transport API which makes it easy to swap the underlying transport mechanism of an XMPP connection during runtime, to added support for [XEP-0373](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0373.html) (OpenPGP for XMPP), [XEP-0424](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html) (Message Retraction) and about a dozen other specifications. Furthermore there is also [Spark 2.9.0](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/spark-2-9-0-released/88551) and an [Openfire plugin to install JSXC](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/jsxc-web-client-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-openfire/88467) now. As usual, releases are available on Maven Central.

python-nbxmpp, the library powering Gajim, had it’s [1.0.2 release](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/tags/nbxmpp-1.0.2). The latest version contains some domain mapping improvements and fixes network issues which occured under certain circumstances after suspending the device.

## Other

Want a coffee with a taste of XMPP? Over the past months [COM8](https://github.com/com8) has been working on creating a [reference implementation](https://github.com/COM8/esp32-jura) for his new XMPPIoT protocol. A first rather basic draft has been published in his [B.Sc. Thesis](https://home.in.tum.de/~sauterf/html-data/Thesis_Smart_Building_Control_with_XMPP_for_IoT.pdf). Using the Windows 10 [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) XMPP client [UWPX](https://uwpx.org), it is possible to register a JURA coffee maker as a new IoT device. This allows sending and receiving commands from and to it, using an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) from Espressif (low-power and low-cost system on a chip microcontroller). The ESP32 functions as a proxy between XMPP and the proprietary JURA protocol.An example video of the working prototype can be found [here](https://twitter.com/UWPX_APP/status/1293461429677436931?s=20) (Twitter).
