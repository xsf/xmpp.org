The modular XMPP client library Smack has [had its first beta release](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-0-beta1-released/88519) for the upcoming release of Smack version 4.4!
The [list of changes](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/wiki/Smack-4.4-Readme-and-Upgrade-Guide) ranges from a new modular transport API which makes it easy to swap the underlying transport mechanism of an XMPP connection during runtime, to added support for XEP-0373: OpenPGP for XMPP, XEP-0424: Message Retraction and a about a dozen other specifications.
As usual, releases are available on Maven Central.

python-nbxmpp, the library powering Gajim, had itâ€™s [1.0.2 release](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp/-/tags/nbxmpp-1.0.2). The latest version contains some domain mapping improvements and fixes network issues which occured under certain circumstances after suspending the device.

### Want a coffee with a taste of XMPP?

Over the past months [COM8](https://github.com/com8) has been working on creating a [reference implementation](https://github.com/COM8/esp32-jura) for his new XMPPIoT protocol. A first (rather) basic draft has been published in his [B.Sc. Thesis](https://home.in.tum.de/~sauterf/html-data/Thesis_Smart_Building_Control_with_XMPP_for_IoT.pdf).

Using the Windows 10 [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) XMPP client [UWPX](https://uwpx.org), it is possible to register a JURA coffee maker as a new IoT device.
This allows sending and receiving commands from and to it, using an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) from Espressif (low-power and low-cost system on a chip microcontroller).
The ESP32 functions as a proxy between XMPP and the proprietary JURA protocol.

An example video of the working prototype can be found [here](https://twitter.com/UWPX_APP/status/1293461429677436931?s=20) (Twitter).
