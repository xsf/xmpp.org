# Collaboration over the Internet! XX May 2020

## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of April 2020.

We are always happy about contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. The drafting process for each newsletter [is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).
Furthermore, we started drafting each new version in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls) - so just add information yourself!

The XSF is renewing its sponsorship for 2020. Many thanks to everyone supporting and especially sponsoring in 2019. We would be happy if your organization would consider [sponsoring also in 2020](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2020-April/037254.html)! If your organization considers sponsoring for the first time, [our mission may interest you as well](https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/mission).

## Articles

[Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), maintainer of libstrophe and contributor to profanity, wrote about using the [XML console in profanity](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/xml-console-in-profanity/) for debugging.

Jan Cieśla from MongooseIM wrote a blog post about how [they thrive their project by the metrics](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/how-data-drives-mongooseim.html).

Can you believe? Zoom uses XMPP for its chat - cool! [Vulnerability](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/04/zoom-user-enumeration.html) - not cool.

## Software releases

Dino now features [Last Message Correction](https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/871ff33ac79f3d17b0260b8bfcd27780038edd6d) for all the typos you made and regrets you have. And also [voice handling in moderated groups](https://github.com/dino/dino/commit/2631a9bdbaf9a40f329f05c55c6e2ea38efeb10c)

[Kaidan 0.5.0](https://www.kaidan.im/2020/04/06/kaidan-0.5.0/) - Bam! Check out their new onboarding!

Let's sum it up like this: Remove of OTR + Rework conference and contact details + show PDF previews + title for audio files = [Pix-Art Messenger 2.3.5](https://github.com/kriztan/Pix-Art-Messenger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Four letters for Windows Users: [UWPX 0.25.0](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.25.0.0) is online with Windows10X support (what ever that Windows 10 is) and a push server. So give it a try!

Monal continues the fight on the iOS front: Included in the upcoming [beta](https://monal.im/blog/4-6-betas/) are support for geo-location messages, [TLS ALPN support](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/issues/206) and improvements on [OpenFire push notifications](https://github.com/anurodhp/Monal/issues/354) as well as many fixes with smack.

Wow - no late April joke - Conversations released version 2.8.0 adding [audio and video calls](https://twitter.com/iNPUTmice/status/1254662039592742913)! Insane!


### Servers

Guus der Kinderen, from the Ignite Realtime Foundation Board, wrote a short article on [how to setup a STUN and TURN service in Openfire for audio and video calls](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/preparing-openfire-for-audio-video-calls-with-conversations/87828).


### Clients and applications

The maintainer of libstrophe, [Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), and contributor to Profanity, created a tool named [xmppconsole](https://github.com/pasis/xmppconsole) which sends raw XMPP stanzas over an XMPP connection and displays the XMPP stream. Main purpose is to study XEPs and debug servers implementation.
The tool is under development. The finished version will support both GTK UI and ncurses UI. In their blog, they also explained how to easier contribute commits to their repository, [read on](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/contributing-a-patch-via-github/)!

## Services

yax.im updated their servers from prosody 0.11 to [prosody-trunk](https://hg.prosody.im/trunk/file/d0e6d5bc7ea2/CHANGES). Read more about the changes [here](https://yaxim.org/blog/2020/04/23/new-prosody-on-yax-dot-im/). Unfortunately with a first [outage](https://yaxim.org/blog/2020/04/27/multi-day-message-archive-outage/) :(

On April 25th, [observe.jabber.network](https://observe.jabber.network) was launched into public beta. It offers free monitoring-as-a-service for federated XMPP domains, checking connectivity via c2s and s2s, as well as optionally in-band registration and federated XMPP pings. Application details and more information are available on the website.


## Extensions and specifications


### Updated

- Version 1.18.0 of XEP-0060 (Publish-Subscribe) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. The protocol enables XMPP entities to create nodes (topics) at a pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub 
therefore adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as the foundation for a wide variety of applications, including news feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow systems, network management systems, and any other application that requires event notifications.
Changelog: 
* Properly specifiy that an empty <item/> is invalid on publish. (jsc)
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html

- Version 0.4 of XEP-0333 (Chat Markers) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification describes a solution of marking the last received, displayed and acknowledged message in a chat.
Changelog:
* Add notes about usage within MUCs. (mw)
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0333.html

- Version 0.4.0 of XEP-0389 (Extensible In-Band Registration) has been released.
Abstract:
This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for in-band  registration with instant messaging servers and other services with which an XMPP entity may initiate a stream. It aims to improve upon the  state of the art and replace XEP-0077: In-Band Registration by allowing multi-factor registration mechanisms, and account recovery.
Changelog:
* Add OOB challenge type.
* Add IQ query for flows.
* Add a glossary.
* Make challenge listings more consistent.
* Cleanup and expand the registrar considerations section.
