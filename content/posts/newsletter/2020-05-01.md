## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of May 2020.

We are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 
The drafting process for each newsletter [is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).
Furthermore, we started drafting each new version in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). We need support in the pre- and post-release redaction processes and the translations. So if you want to help out feel free to join the [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join)!

Highlights are (amongst others): improved group chat system, completely rewritten network code, and a new account creation assistant. But there is much more to discover.
