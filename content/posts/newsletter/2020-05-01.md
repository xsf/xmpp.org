# XMPP@home - 3 June 2020

## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of May 2020.

We started drafting each new version in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/pulls). 
And we are always happy to welcome contributors. Just join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. 

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here too!
If you can only spend a few minutes, that is already helping. We would really like to keep it as a community effort!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the draft
- Translations - especially French, German and Spanish

The drafting process for each newsletter [is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

## Software releases

It has been almost a year since the release of Gajim 1.1.3. A year of developing new features, cleaning up old code, and fixing bugs. This month, it is finally the time for a [first beta release of Gajim 1.2](https://gajim.org/post/2020-05-08-gajim-1.2.0-beta1-released/). Highlights are (amongst others): improved group chat system, completely rewritten network code, and a new account creation assistant. But there is much more to discover.

### Clients and applications

[Gajim Development News May 2020](https://gajim.org/post/2020-05-26-development-news-may/): New account badges and the great plugin overhaul. In preparation of the upcoming 1.2 release, many plugins have been revisited. Check out the new file preview!

Goffi released [Salut à Toi progress note for calendar week 21](https://www.goffi.org/b/kmebCba3m38dr9sgzgGrkp/progress-note)!

[Poezio](https://poez.io) released 0.13.0 and 0.13.1 which now requires python 3.7. These versions bring Poezio into the club of OMEMO supporting clients and also enable HTTP upload via dedicated plugins. Check the full [changelog](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/poezio/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG) to look at all the improvements of these versions.

[Biboumi](https://biboumi.louiz.org/), the XMPP/IRC gateway, released in version 0.8.5, fixing compilation issues with GCC 10.

The python based XMPP automatic file sender [Errol has been updated to v2.0.1](https://blog.agayon.be/errol_update1.html) which modernizes its async i/o calls and adds more privacy. By moving from 'aionotify' to the better maintained 'watchdog', Errol theoretically extends its support from Linux only to Windows, Mac OS X and FreeBSD.

## Services

blabber.im has now [support for IPv6](https://blabber.im/blabber-im-ist-nun-ipv6-tauglich/) and they created an [invitation link which works for their server but also for every other ID](https://blabber.im/en/i-moved/). If you moved to an XMPP based chat client, you can now put this link into the status of your previous non-XMPP chat clients. Your contacts will then have all the information to reach you and may also follow you in the XMPP world.

jabber.org migrates its server to prosody. [Stay informed!](https://www.jabber.org/notices.html)

yax.im rolled out [new anti-spam measures](https://yaxim.org/blog/2020/05/12/new-anti-spam-measures/). You are maybe interested in the '[The Jabber Spam Fighting Manifesto](https://github.com/JabberSPAM/jabber-spam-fighting-manifesto)', too.

## Libraries



The XMPP library for Python 3.7+, [Slixmpp](https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp), was [updated to version 1.5.0](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/jdev/2020-May/090424.html), with minor releases 1.5.1 and 1.5.2. The [changelog]( https://lab.louiz.org/poezio/slixmpp/-/tags/slix-1.5.0) shows improvements of numerous XEPs and preliminary support for OMEMO.

## Google Summer of Code
