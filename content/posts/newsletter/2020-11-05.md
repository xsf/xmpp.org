## Articles

_To everyone involved, please do not just drop links, rather try to make a short and decent 
formulated description of what is the main outcome of your source. This will help us a lot! 
You do not need to use a formal tone, be passionate about why this motivates you or what you work on!_

MongooseIM takes advantage of XMPP's extensibility to allow its users to customise their solution based on their needs.
A great example of this is their (case study with Pando Health)[https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/case-studies.html#replacing-whatsapp-and-legacy-pagers-with-mongooseim-in-healthcare-29-doc], an award-winning chat system for health care that is now the most used offering in the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS).

with a TOML configuration, Kubernetes ready helm charts and structured logging. (See the full list of new and improved features in the blog post
accompanying MongooseIM 4.0 release)[https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/what-s-new-in-mongooseim-4-0-the-friendly-mongoose.html]. To celebrate the release of MongooseIM 4.0 the team put together (a guide to the common considerations companies go through when deciding on a chat solution)[https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-instant-messaging-and-in-application-chat.html], this includes whether to build their own or buy a product-as-a-service

## Other

The owner of the [joinxmpp.org](https://joinxmpp.org) domain is lacking time. They wrote a short description of the original goals and say they are now looking for somebody motivated to take on the project.

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html).

### Proposed Extensions

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No Proposed Extensions this month.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0444](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0444.html) (Message Reactions)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-10-07.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-09-30.

### Updated

-   Version 0.7.0 of [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) (OMEMO Encryption)
    -   Various fixes, clarifications and general improvements.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedbacks gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Draft

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0393](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0393.html) (Message Styling)
    -   Accepted as Draft as per Council vote from 2020-10-07.
