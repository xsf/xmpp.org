## Software news

### Clients and applications

A new major version of Movim is out. With improved notifications, new video-conferencing and chat features and some major performances overhaul. A new version for the Android application is also available to integrate all those features in the Android environment. Discover all the improvements of this new release on the official release note [Movim 0.18 – Oterma](https://nl.movim.eu/?node/pubsub.movim.eu/Movim/11655111-e7ad-4e0c-975c-3c78755d22aa).

[Gajim Development News (September)](https://gajim.org/post/2020-09-27-development-news-september/): 🥳 This month’s post marks one year of Gajim Development News! The rework of Gajim’s Preferences window has been completed. We improved group chat invitations and made group chat settings easier to access. Also, joining a group chat is now much prettier.

MCabber, the venerable old text UI client, has been released in [version 1.1.1](https://github.com/McKael/mcabber/releases/tag/1.1.1). Apart from bugfixes, support for displaying the number of unread messages and refactorization of carbon message handling has been implemented.

The iOS and MacOS client Monal has a [new push server](https://monal.im/blog/monal-push-server-upgrade/)! This is one of many changes (Message Archive Management has been improved as well!) in the backend of Monal which will find their way in the future updates. Be prepared and get a glimpse in the [Monal Beta Testflight](https://monal.im/blog/news-betas-up-for-4-8/).

The python SDK for GE WiFi-enabled kitchen appliances, [gekitchen](https://github.com/ajmarks/gekitchen), made its first github release. The primary goal is to use it to power integrations for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), though that will probably need to wait on some new entity types. It is using XMPP as a mean to authenticate since it is what the The GE SmartHQ app uses to communicate with devices.

## Extensions and specifications

Read more about the [standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html).

### Updated

- Version 2.11.0 of [XEP-0004](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html) (Data Forms)
  - Further clarify the presence requirements for the type attribute on fields.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedbacks gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

- [XEP-0411](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0411.html) (Bookmarks Conversion)

### Proposed Extensions

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

- [XMPP Compliance Suites 2021](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/cs-2021.html)
  - This document defines XMPP application categories for different use cases (Core, Web, IM, and Mobile), and specifies the required XEPs that client and server software needs to implement for compliance with the use cases.
