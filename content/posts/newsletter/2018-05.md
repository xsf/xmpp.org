Welcome to another edition of the XMPP newsletter.

## News

The next release of [Salut à Toi will include file sharing](https://www.goffi.org/b/hGKs6B4wd8dsgNZd5MzQjN/file-sharing-landing-next-release-salut?utm_source=xmppnewsletter).
Sharing files directly between two users has been possible before, but now it's
possible to share a file hierarchy, or in other words one or several
directories. To share with someone, just use their XMPP address (JID).

[Christopher Muclumbus](https://muclumbus.jabbercat.org/?utm_source=xmppnewsletter) 
is a new project to publicly list XMPP chat rooms.
It provides a web interface with full-text search for room names, descriptions
and addresses. Only rooms which are configured to be publicly listed are shown.

Blazemeter have written about [5 ways to load test chat plugins with JMeter](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/5-ways-to-load-test-popular-chat-plugins-with-jmeter?utm_campaign=Blog%20Post%20-%205%20Ways%20to%20Load%20Test%20Popular%20Chat%20Plugins%20with%20JMeter?utm_source=xmppnewsletter).
JMeter is an open source Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.
The article briefly discusses XMPP and mentions that JMeter has a plugin which
provides support for XMPP.

Paul Schaub has been [blogging regularly in May](https://blogs.fsfe.org/vanitasvitae/2018/05/?utm_source=xmppnewsletter)
about his Google Summer of Code project, adding OpenPGP support for SMACK
([XEP-0373](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0373.html) and [XEP-0374](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0374.html)).

[Fanout has removed XMPP support](http://blog.fanout.io/2018/05/18/goodbye-xmpp/?utm_source=xmppnewsletter) from their cloud offering.
It was never used at scale, and was mainly relegated to chat bots that needed
compatibility with Google Talk. However, as Google phased out XMPP federation,
such usefulness dwindled.

### Events

An XMPP sprint is being organized for August in Cambridge.
The event will take place in the Collabora offices and dates are still to be
finalized. You still have a chance to vote for your preferred date and to suggest
topics for the sprint. Visit [https://col.la/xmppsprint](https://col.la/xmppsprint)
and join the groupchat [xmpp-sprint@chat.cluxia.eu](xmpp:xmpp-sprint@chat.cluxia.eu?join).

### GDPR

On 25th May the European Union's "General Data Protection Regulation" has come
into force. The XMPP community has been discussing its impact and have come up
with various ideas and strategies on how to ensure compliance.

Discussions happened regularly in the [xsf@muc.xmpp.org](xmpp:xsf@muc.xmpp.org) groupchat.

There is a [GDPR page on the XMPP wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/GDPR) which
collects and summarises the results of these discussions.

Winfried Tilanus, who's been active in these discussions, created a new
proto-XEP: [Best practices for GDPR compliant deployment of XMPP](https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/gdpr.html)

JC Brand wrote a [blogpost about the Gulaschprogrammiernacht](https://opkode.com/blog/2018-gulaschprogrammiernacht/)
a hacker/maker event in Karlsruhe, where six people worked on XMPP-related projects and plans
where hatched to organize a sprint in Cambridge.
