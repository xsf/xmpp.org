## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html). Communication around Standards and Extensions happens in the [Standards Mailing List](https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards) ([online archive](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/)).

### Proposed

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No XEPs proposed this month.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0460](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0460.html) (Pubsub Caching Hints)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2021-07-21. (XEP Editor (jsc))

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP is not updated for more than twelve months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 1.21.0 of [XEP-0060](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html) (Publish-Subscribe)
    -   Revert change from version 1.15.5 which changed meta-data to metadata in wire protocol. That was an unintended breaking change which has now been reverted. (pep)

-   Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0214](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0214.html) (File Repository and Sharing)
    -   Revert change from version 0.2.1 which changed meta-data to metadata in wire protocol. That was an unintended breaking change which has now been reverted. (rm)

-   Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0248](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0248.html) (PubSub Collection Nodes)
    -   Revert change from version 0.2.1 which changed meta-data to metadata in wire protocol. That was an unintended breaking change which has now been reverted. (rm)

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0283](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0283.html) (Moved)
    -   Re-write the flow with a more focused approach. (mw)

-   Version 1.1.0 of [XEP-0429](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0429.html) (Special Interests Group End to End Encryption)
    -   Add discussion venue after creation by the Infrastructure Team. (mw)

-   Version 1.24.0 of [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html) (XMPP Extension Protocols)
    -   Change "Draft" to "Stable". (ssw)

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Draft

-   No Draft this month.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.

## Help us to build the newsletter

We started drafting in this [simple pad](https://yopad.eu/p/xmpp-newsletter-365days) in parallel to our efforts in the [XSF Github repository](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/milestone/3). We are always happy to welcome contributors. Do not hesitate to join the discussion in our [Comm-Team group chat (MUC)](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort. We really need more support!

You have a project and write about it? Please consider sharing your news or events here, and promote it to a large audience! 
And even if you can only spend a few minutes of support, these would already be helpful!

Tasks which need to be done on a regular basis are for example:

- Aggregation of news in the XMPP universe
- Short formulation of news and events
- Summary of the monthly communication on extensions (XEP)
- Review of the newsletter draft
- Preparation for media images
- Translations: especially German and Spanish
