## Article

Just how scalable is the XMPP server MongooseIM? See how Bartek Górny, one of the MongooseIM team members,
achieved almost 2.5 million connections, passing 45 thousand messages per second.
And, why he thinks 10 million connections is easily achievable. Find out more in
[_Scaling a Mongoose_](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/scaling-a-mongoose-how-scalable-is-the-mongooseim-xmpp-server.html).

_To everyone involved, please do not just drop links, rather try to make a short and decent 
formulated description of what is the main outcome of your source. This will help us a lot! 
You do not need to use a formal tone, be passionate about why this motivates you or what you work on!_

## Software news


### Clients and applications

[Gajim 1.2.1](https://gajim.org/post/2020-07-08-gajim-1.2.1-released/) has been released. Just two weeks after the release of Gajim 1.2, the next update is already there. Gajim 1.2.1 features spam reporting, enhancements for the plugin system, and some bug fixes.

Profanity released version 0.9.5 to fix a potential segmentation fault when using the `/theme properties` command which displays colour settings for current theme.

### Servers

[MongooseIM 3.7.1 has been released!](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/releases/tag/3.7.1)
This builds on top of the 3.7.0 May release, which introduced a range
of new SCRAM-SHA-* authentication methods, support for channel binding
for all SCRAM methods, [XEP-0424: Message Retraction](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html),
and support for [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt).
3.7.1 improves on that by speeding up all the SCRAM methods significantly!
The last bit is a lesson learned thanks to
[Tide, the MongooseIM continuous load testing platform](https://tide.erlang-solutions.com/).
This version is not only extra fortified, but also fast and [scalable](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/scaling-a-mongoose-how-scalable-is-the-mongooseim-xmpp-server.html)!
