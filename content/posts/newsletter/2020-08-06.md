JC Brand created an [XMPP job board](https://xmpp.work/)! This enables people to review job offers as 
well as advertise XMPP services. Please take a look, post your own offers and recommend it. XMPP works!

## Article

Just how scalable is the XMPP server MongooseIM? See how Bartek Górny, one of the MongooseIM team members,
achieved almost 2.5 million connections, passing 45 thousand messages per second.
And, why he thinks 10 million connections is easily achievable. Find out more in
[_Scaling a Mongoose_](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/scaling-a-mongoose-how-scalable-is-the-mongooseim-xmpp-server.html).

Pep., contributor to the [Poezio XMPP client](https://poez.io) and member of the XSF board, 
[wrote an article][https://bouah.net/2020/07/what-about-design/] detailing his thoughts on XMPP and on the importance of design.

The multi-platform desktop client [Gajim 1.2.1](https://gajim.org/post/2020-07-08-gajim-1.2.1-released/) has been released. Just two weeks after the release of Gajim 1.2, the next update is already there. Gajim 1.2.1 features spam reporting as specified by [XEP-0377](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0377.html), automatic activation of shipped plugins which implies OMEMO available by default, and some bug fixes. Audio/Video calls gain some improvements, but remain highly experimental.
[More development news from July](https://gajim.org/post/2020-07-26-development-news-july/): an automatic update check for Gajim on Wndows/MacOS, account password storage enhancements, an OMEMO fix, and many small improvements.

Profanity, the text based user interface client, released version 0.9.5 to fix a potential segmentation fault when using the `/theme properties` command. It is used to display colour settings for the current theme.

Anurodh Pokharel made [new betas available for the upcoming Monal 4.7 for iOS and mac](https://monal.im/blog/update-chat-ui-and-new-betas/). In addition to stability fixes, these bring typing notifications as well as the new top navigation bar.

### Servers

[MongooseIM 3.7.1 has been released!](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/releases/tag/3.7.1)
This one is built on top of the 3.7.0 May release, which introduced support for channel binding to prevent [replay attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack)
for all methods of [SCRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism "Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism"),  a family of modern, password-based challenge–response authentication mechanisms providing authentication of a user to a server. This previous version also provided a range of new SCRAM authentication methods based on different flavors of the [SHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms "Secure Hash Algorithms") cryptographic hash functions, the ability to retract messages as specified by [XEP-0424](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html), and support for [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) which safely transport connection information such as a client's address across multiple layers of NAT or TCP proxies. Version 3.7.1 improves on that by speeding up all the SCRAM methods significantly!
This last bit is a lesson learned thanks to [Tide, the MongooseIM continuous load testing platform](https://tide.erlang-solutions.com/).
Hence a new release that is not only extra fortified, but also fast and scalable (cf. the Article section of this newsletter)!

[Tigase XMPP Server 8.1.0 General Availability has been released](https://tigase.net/tigase-xmpp-server-8.1.0-ga/) and it is packed with improvements! 
`SASL-EXTERNAL` mechanism defined in [XEP-0178](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0178.html) (Best Practices for Use of SASL EXTERNAL with Certificates) to allow  certificate based authenticated connections was added for server-to-server connections, greatly improving compliance with the XMPP federated network. Depending on support in other servers, it’s possible to use both SASL-EXTERNAL and Diallback, another authentication mechanism defined by [XEP-0220](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0220.html). Set of XMPP extensions were added: 
 - [XEP-0398](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0398.html) (User Avatar to vCard-Based Avatars Conversion)
 - [XEP-0156](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html) (Discovering Alternative XMPP Connection Methods)
 - [XEP-0410](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0410.html) (MUC Self-Ping (Schrödinger’s Chat))
 - [XEP-0153](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html) (vCard-Based Avatars)
 - [XEP-0411](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0411.html) (Bookmarks Conversion)
 - [XEP-0157](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0157.html) (Contact Addresses for XMPP Services)

This version also improves management of multiple domains in virtual hosts and enable by default a new anti-spam plugin.

## Libraries

[Tigase JaXMPP 3.3.0 has been released](https://tigase.net/tigase-client-library-v330-released/)!
Main features included in this release are support for OMEMO encryption, making it easier to carry out encrypted conversations, and support for [XEP-0305](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0305.html) (XMPP Quickstart) allowing connections to be established faster. Apart from that, [SCRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism "Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism") support was extended with SCRAM-SHA512 flavour. Service items discovery can now be controlled with [XEP-0059](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0059.html) (Result Set Management). DataForms with multiple items got implemented and MUC message delivery was improved. Last but not least, connectivity with Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) was fixed.

Version 1.0.1 of [python-nbxmpp](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/python-nbxmpp), the library developed for and used by Gajim development team, has been released. This version includes a fix for a bug where messages from ChatSecure could not be decrypted after a longer period of time has passed. It also includes some fixes 
for Websocket connections.
