Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of November 2020.

This will be the last newsletter release for this (crazy) year, it was great to have you here reading! Many thanks to your contributors and reviews, the XMPP Newsletter is a
community work and if you are interested to join us next year - feel free to join!

For everyone of us having a new years break we wish you a nice time - until then stay safe and see you in the next year!

## XSF Announcement

We would like to make an informational announcement about an important circumstance regarding certificates to all parties involved in XMPP.
If you or releated parties are affected please spread the word on this:

Let's Encrypt announced to [switch away from their Root CA certificate cross-signed by IdenTrust](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html). 
This means that old client devices (especially the roughly one third of Android phones running Android 7.0 and older) will consider Let's Encrypt certificates issued after January 11th 2021 as untrustworthy. 
This problem will not go away, as the IdenTrust cross-signed certificate will expire in September, but there are some possible mitigations:
- For users: It is possible, but not very straight-forward to [add the new Root CA certificate to the system trust store](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887/)
- For client developers: You can bundle the new [ISG Root X1](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/) certificate with the app, or implement a manual CA approval mechanism like [Memorizing Trust Manager](https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager)
- For server operators: You can use the ["alternate" option](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/transition-to-isrgs-root-delayed-until-jan-11-2021/125516) between January and September to obtain certificates signed by the old IdenTrust-based root. 

The implementation of the ISRG Root X1 certificate is [explained in this article](https://www.stoutner.com/lets-encrypt-isrg-root-x1-and-privacy-browser/).

## Other

## Extensions and specifications

@wurstsalat3000 as always I left the previous section for you edits!

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html).

### Proposed Extensions

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   No Proposed Extensions this month.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0444](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0444.html) (Message Reactions)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-10-07.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-09-30.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP isn’t updated for more than six months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   [XEP-0353](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0353.html) (Jingle Message Initiation)

-   [XEP-0292](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0292.html) (vCard4 Over XMPP)

### Updated

-   Version 0.3 of [XEP-0371](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0371.html) (Jingle ICE Transport Method)
    -   Replaced RFC 5245 with RFC 8445
    -   Introduced ice2 transport attribute for backward compatibility
    -   Clarified ICE restart procedure
    -   Clarified remote-candidate usage
    -   Changed remote-candidate notification procedure (sent all at once now)
    -   Replaced wrong reference to RFC 6455 with correct one: RFC 6544
    -   Allow sharing <gathering-complete/> element with remaining candidates

-   Version 1.3.0 of [XEP-0050](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0050.html) (Ad-Hoc Commands)
    -   Clarify illegal uses of 'execute'.

-   Version 0.7.0 of [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) (OMEMO Encryption)
    -   Various fixes, clarifications and general improvements.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)

### Draft

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0411](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0411.html) (Bookmarks Conversion)
    -   Accepted as Draft by vote of Council on 2020-10-14.

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0352](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0352.html) (Client State Indication)
    -   Accepted as Draft as per Council vote from 2020-08-26.

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0393](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0393.html) (Message Styling)
    -   Accepted as Draft as per Council vote from 2020-10-07.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.
