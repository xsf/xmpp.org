## XSF Announcement

We would like to make an informational announcement about an important circumstance regarding certificates to all parties involved in XMPP.
If you or related parties are affected please spread the word on this:

Let's Encrypt announced to [switch away from their Root CA certificate cross-signed by IdenTrust](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html). 
This means that old client devices (especially the roughly one third of Android phones running Android 7.0 and older) will consider Let's Encrypt certificates issued after January 11th 2021 as untrustworthy. 
This problem will not go away, as the IdenTrust cross-signed certificate will expire in September, but there are some possible mitigations:
- For users: It is possible, but not very straight-forward to [add the new Root CA certificate to the system trust store](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887/)
- For client developers: You can bundle the new [ISG Root X1](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/) certificate with the app, or implement a manual CA approval mechanism like [Memorizing Trust Manager](https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager)
- For server operators: You can use the ["alternate" option](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/transition-to-isrgs-root-delayed-until-jan-11-2021/125516) between January and September to obtain certificates signed by the old IdenTrust-based root. 

The implementation of the ISRG Root X1 certificate is [explained in this article](https://www.stoutner.com/lets-encrypt-isrg-root-x1-and-privacy-browser/).

## Other

## Extensions and specifications

Developers and other standards experts from around the world collaborate on these extensions, developing new specifications for emerging practices, and refining existing ways of doing things. Proposed by anybody, the particularly successful ones end up as Final or Active - depending on their type - while others are carefully archived as Deferred. This life cycle is described in [XEP-0001](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html), which contains the formal and canonical definitions for the types, states, and processes. [Read more about the standards process](https://xmpp.org/about/standards-process.html).

### Proposed Extensions

The XEP development process starts by writing up an idea and submitting it to the XMPP Editor. Within two weeks, the Council decides whether to accept this proposal as an Experimental XEP.

-   Several extensions have been proposed this month. They have been accepted by the council, and are listed in the New section below.

### New

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0449](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0449.html) (Stickers)
    -   This specification provides a protocol to send stickers and to create and share sticker packs.
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-11-18.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0448](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0448.html) (Encryption for stateless file sharing)
    -   This specification provides a protocol for sharing encrypted files using the stateless file sharing protocol (XEP-0447).
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-11-18.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0447](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0447.html) (Stateless file sharing)
    -   This specification describes a protocol for stateless asynchronous file sharing with integrity and transport flexibility. It allows clients to provide a good interoperable user experience in combination with Carbons and MAM.
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-11-18.

-   Version 0.1.0 of [XEP-0446](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0446.html) (File metadata element)
    -   This specification defines a generic file metadata element to be used in other specifications.
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-11-18.

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0445](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0445.html) (Pre-Authenticated In-Band Registration)
    -   This document extends the In-Band-Registration protocol to use invitation tokens, e.g. for registering accounts on non-public servers.
    -   Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-11-04.

### Deferred

If an experimental XEP isn’t updated for more than six months, it will be moved off Experimental to Deferred. If there is another update, it will put the XEP back onto Experimental.

-   No XEPs deferred this month.

### Updated

-   Version 0.6.0 of [XEP-0373](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0373.html) (OpenPGP for XMPP)
    -   Fix 'to'-attribute requirements: All content elements which are signed using OpenPGP need that attribute to prevent Surreptitious Forward Attacks. The <crypt/> element does not require one, as the intented recipient is established by the encryption itself. The XEP had the requirements for <sign/> and <crypt/> mixed up.

-   Version 0.6.0 of [XEP-0389](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0389.html) (Extensible In-Band Registration)
    -   Error out if a client selects an invalid flow.

-   Version 0.3.0 of [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)
    -   Add more notable XEPs.

-   Version 0.2.0 of [XEP-0438](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0438.html) (Best practices for password hashing and storage)
    -   Update to match draft-ietf-kitten-password-storage-01.

-   Version 1.34.0 of [XEP-0045](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) (Multi-User Chat)
    -   Specify the use of a delay element in the initial subject message.

-   Version 1.3.0 of [XEP-0118](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0118.html) (User Tune)
    -   Add further tags for non-pop music.

-   Version 1.2.0 of [XEP-0308](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0308.html) (Last Message Correction)
    -   Reword note about how to handle LMC in cases where it is not clear that all recipients support it.

### Last Call

Last calls are issued once everyone seems satisfied with the current XEP status. After the Council decides whether the XEP seems ready, the XMPP Editor issues a Last Call for comments. The feedback gathered during the Last Call help improving the XEP before returning it to the Council for advancement to Draft.

-   No Last Call this month.

### Draft

-   Version 1.0.0 of [XEP-0443](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0443.html) (XMPP Compliance Suites 2021)
    -   Accept as Draft as per Council vote from 2020-11-11.

### Call for Experience

A Call For Experience - like a Last Call, is an explicit call for comments, but in this case it's mostly directed at people who've implemented, and ideally deployed, the specification. The Council then votes to move it to Final.

-   No Call for Experience this month.
