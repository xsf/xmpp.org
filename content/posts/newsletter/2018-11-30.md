## News

Paul Schaub has written about a [QR-code generator for OMEMO](https://blog.jabberhead.tk/2018/11/03/qr-code-generator-for-omemo/)
which he has been working on. It encodes the Jabber-ID of the owner as well as any OMEMO
fingerprints they choose to include.

JC Brand has written about the [recent XMPP sprint held in Dusseldorf](https://opkode.com/blog/xmpp-sprint-dusseldorf/).
Featuring sushi, ramen, whiskey, protocol discussions, translations, bugfixes, documentation, releases, hacks and coding.

The [Monal Android and Mac client now shows a simple introduction to
XMPP](https://monal.im/blog/the-welcome-screen/) with
lovely illustrations of Peter rabbit, as he enters and escapes Mr McGregor's garden.
There are also new [empty state screens](https://monal.im/blog/the-empty-state/) with similar illustrations.

In the Netherlands, a chat service called IronChat, with an Android client which
is apparently a fork of [Conversations](https://conversations.im/), was 
compromised when the police somehow took control of their centralized server
and started a man-in-the-middle attack.
The users received notices that fingerprints aren't verified, but they didn't
bother to verify them otherwise they would have uncovered the attack.
It seems the service was popular with criminals, which is why the police got involved,
and various arrests were made. [The original article in Dutch](https://nos.nl/artikel/2258309-beveiliging-door-politie-gekraakte-cryptofoons-was-twijfelachtig.html)

The well-known Kuketz blog in Germany wrote an article [XMPP is not the savior - but a solution](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuketz-blog.de%2Fmessenger-xmpp-ist-nicht-der-heilsbringer-aber-eine-loesung%2F)
(Google machine-translated version). Here's the [original German version](https://www.kuketz-blog.de/messenger-xmpp-ist-nicht-der-heilsbringer-aber-eine-loesung/).
It's in part a response to [XMPP: Admin-in-the-middle](https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/xmpp-aitm/), written by the InfoSec Handbook
which details how XMPP server administrators have access to user's metadata and
other sensitive information.

The German email provider mailbox.org, has [unveiled a revamped website](https://mailbox.org/en/post/a-new-logo-a-new-website-new-software-versions-and-new-features-at-mailbox-org)
with new features, including migration to a new XMPP chat server (Ejabberd)
and deployment of [Converse.js](http://conversejs.org/) as webchat.

German IT website Golem.de has written about Daniel Gultsch's new free Android app
[Quicksy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.quicksy.client)
which allows users to sign up with their cellphone number.
Here's the [Google machine-translated
version](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=de&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.golem.de%2Fnews%2Fquicksy-mit-der-telefonnummer-ins-jabber-netz-1811-137855.html)
and the [original German article](https://www.golem.de/news/quicksy-mit-der-telefonnummer-ins-jabber-netz-1811-137855.html).

This Stardust blog post explains how you can [Write an XMPP bot in half an hour](https://starbeamrainbowlabs.com/blog/article.php?article=posts%2F327-Write-an-XMPP-bot-in-half-an-hour.html)

Andrea Schäfer provided a [technical update and demo of Chatty](https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-progress-report-19/),
the XMPP-capable chat client that is being developed for the upcoming Purism phone.
This was posted already a while ago, but only came to my attention recently.
