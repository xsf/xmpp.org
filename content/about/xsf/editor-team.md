The charter of the team is as follows:

> Since 2001, the XMPP Extensions Editor has managed numerous details
> of the XSF’s Standards Process (see [1] and [2]) and has also
> functioned as the responsible party for the XMPP Registrar (see [3]
> and [4]). In order to manage these processes in a sustainable way,
> this charter defines an XSF Work Team with the following goals:
>
> 1. Refine and continually improve team work processes for management of
> the XEP Editor and XMPP Registrar functions, consistent with XEP-0001
> and XEP-0053.

> 2. Put those processes into practice by efficiently dispatching the
> responsibilities of the XEP Editor and XMPP Registrar functions.

> Collectively, the members of the work team are expected to have
> familiarity with the use of source control systems, the XML formats
> used for both XEPs and XSF registries, basic build and release
> processes, and mailing list administration. Members of the team are
> also expected to work with appropriate attention to detail and
> awareness of information security, to coordinate amongst themselves
> regarding the rapid and transparent handling of their tasks, and to
> treat XEP authors and information registrants with honesty and respect.

> Members of the work team shall be selected by the XMPP Council after a
> call for volunteers from among the XSF membership, and shall be approved
> by the XSF Board of Directors.
