Communications about the Jabber licensing program are being sent to the industry in general now that XSF has established a trademark licensing program. If you know of entities or persons using the Jabber mark without a license and without the required legend, please notify us at the address on the [contact page](/contact), complete with the details. We will then contact that entity or person and attempt to negotiate a license agreement with them, or will take such other further legal action as might be necessary. We are serious about enforcing the trademark rights, not because of the revenues, but because of the desire of the XSF and the responsible members of the Jabber community to see to it that the mark is available to anyone who wishes to uses it in a reasonable form and in such manner as would not preclude others from using it for their own Jabber products or conflict with a pre-existing license to use the mark.
