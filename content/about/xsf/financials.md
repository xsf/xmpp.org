In 2024, the XSF's income is estimated to have been as follows:

| Open Collective        |   $850.15 | Contributions to projects we sponsor    |

NOTE: $5000 in sponsorships for the year 2024 were received in 2023.

In 2024, the XSF's expenses are estimated to have been as follows:

| Expense Type   | Amount    | Notes                                           |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Conferences    | $11099.02 | XMPP Summit, FOSDEM, meetups, etc. (see note)   |
| Infrastructure |   $690.92 | Digital Ocean, Tarsnap backups, etc.            |
| Business Fees  |   $527.00 | Corporate registration, taxes, P.O. box, etc.   |
| TOTAL          | $12316.94 |                                                 |

NOTE: Because we pre-pay to reserve the meeting room, XMPP Summit expenses can be spread across two years (e.g., some costs for the Summit held in 2025 were paid in 2024).

Previous years to follow, once we settle on the format and level of detail.
