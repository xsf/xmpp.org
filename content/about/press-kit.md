# What is XMPP

XMPP (E**x**tensible **M**essaging and **P**resence **P**rotocol) is a powerful, open, secure, standards-based protocol. It is a freely-available technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including [instant messaging](/uses/instant-messaging/), [online gaming](/uses/gaming/), presence, collaboration, [voice and video calling](/uses/webrtc/), [Internet of Things](/uses/internet-of-things/), tactical military messaging, [mobile cloud push](/uses/social/), and [more](/uses/).

XMPP was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community to provide an open, decentralized alternative to the closed instant messaging services at that time. XMPP offers [several key advantages](/about/technology-overview/) over such services.

# Our mission

The [XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF)](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation/) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organization with the mission to build an open, secure, feature-rich, federated infrastructure for real-time communication and collaboration over the Internet. We seek to achieve that goal by developing the world’s best open protocols for instant messaging, presence, and other forms of near-real-time communication, based on the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)’s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). By “best” we mean simplest, most extensible, most powerful, most secure. Moreover, we value freedom, openness, and good technical design.

The XSF’s product is [protocols](/extensions/); the XSF’s market is developers. We do not write code; instead, we make it possible for others to write code. We listen to developers, service providers, and end users regarding the kinds of problems they want to solve, and we work with them to create protocols that solve those problems. Our [standards process](/about/standards-process/) is developer-friendly. We strenuously avoid design by committee and we place a premium on the values that built the Internet in the first place: rough consensus and running code.
