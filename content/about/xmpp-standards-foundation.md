The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose [primary mission is to define open protocols](/about/xsf/mission) for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETF’s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers, and end users. In addition, the XSF administers the [Jabber Trademark Licensing Program](/about/xsf/jabber-trademark).

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a Council (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). The Board also appoints various work teams and roles. Those are:

- [Editor team](/about/xsf/editor-team)
- [Infrastructure team](/about/xsf/infrastructure-team)
- [Communication team](/about/xsf/comm-team/)
- [Summits, Conferences, and Meetups team (SCAM)](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summits_Conferences_And_Meetups_team)
- [Executive Director, Treasurer, and Secretary](/about/xsf/people).
