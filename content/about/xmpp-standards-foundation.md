The XMPP Standards Foundation (also known as the XSF and formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is an independent, nonprofit standards development organisation whose [primary mission is to define open protocols](/about/xsf/mission) for presence, instant messaging, and real-time communication and collaboration on top of the IETF’s Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

The XSF also provides information and infrastructure to the worldwide community of Jabber/XMPP developers, service providers, and end users. In addition, the XSF administers the [Jabber Trademark Licensing Program](/about/xsf/jabber-trademark).

At the core of the XSF is its elected Membership who, in turn, elect a [Council](#council) (the technical leadership) and Board (the business leadership). The [Board](#board) also appoints various work teams and roles.

## The Board{#board}

The Board of Directors of the XMPP Standards Foundation oversees the business affairs of the organisation. As elected by the XSF membership, the Board of Directors consists of the following individuals:

- __Dave Cridland__ is an independent consultant for Extensible Messaging Ltd, working mostly on XMPP-based messaging things for a number of clients. This isn't his first time on the Board, and he has been on the XMPP Council for a number of years as well. Will nobody ever learn? He has worked extensively on multiple XMPP server projects, including Isode's M-Link, Ignite Realtime's Openfire, and his own Metre project. His hobbies include working on XMPP servers, which is just as well, and writing about himself in the third person, which is really coming into its own right now. Drop him a message via [XMPP](xmpp:dwd@dave.cridland.net).
- __Edward Maurer__ is working in engineering automation (energy sector, non-XMPP) and is volunteering in XMPP since more than five years already. Since 2020 he is thriving the [XSF Communication Team](https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/comm-team/). Besides successfully supporting the XMPP Community and its projects he is co-author of [XMPP Providers](https://providers.xmpp.net/).

- __Ralph Meijer__ is an independent consultant for Nuntians Services B.V., working on real-time communications systems, event-driven architectures, and observability. He is the lead developer of several XMPP related projects and services, including Wokkel and the XMPP support in Twisted, the Idavoll pubsub component, and Planet Jabber. Ralph has been member of the XMPP Council from 2004 to 2013 and Director since 2013. You can contact him via [email](mailto:ralphm@ik.nu) or [XMPP](xmpp:ralphm@ik.nu).
- __Florian Schmaus__ is a software developer and long-standing contributor to the XMPP community. He is leading the development of Smack, an XMPP client library targeting Android and Java. His interests include operating systems, parallel runtime systems, and systems software in general. Fittingly, Florian also conducts research in this area and helps students unravel the black box inside modern computing systems. Besides that, he enjoys spending time with his family.
- __Arne-Bruen Vogelsang__ is the founder and lead developer of [monocles](https://monocles.eu/more/). Whereas he is maintaining two public XMPP servers and [monocles chat]( https://f-droid.org/packages/de.monocles.chat/) is a known XMPP chat client for Android, he's also working on other non-XMPP related open source projects.
During his studies he learned a lot about the need for more ethical and fair digital and technological solutions. He also experienced the business side for founding a sustainable company providing open source solutions.
He advocates and supports XMPP and open source since many years and is an official XSF member since 2023.
