As with email, you need an account with a service provider.
Use a [public provider from the curated list of **XMPP Providers**](https://providers.xmpp.net) or be your own provider [by hosting a server yourself](https://xmpp.org/software/servers/).

**XMPP Providers** takes various aspects into consideration to recommend providers.
