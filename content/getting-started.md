## 2. Create an account

As with email, you need an account with a service provider.
Use a [public provider from the curated list of **XMPP Providers**](https://providers.xmpp.net) or be your own provider [by hosting a server yourself](https://xmpp.org/software/).

**XMPP Providers** takes various aspects into consideration to recommend providers.
There are several other (uncurated) lists of providers:

* [Curated XMPP server list at providers.xmpp.net](https://providers.xmpp.net/)
* [Public XMPP servers by jabber.at](https://list.jabber.at)
* [Open list of public XMPP servers by 404.city](https://xmpp-servers.404.city)

## 3. Log in! That's it

Using your client, log in and start adding your friends, or [visit one of the many chatrooms](https://search.jabber.network/)!
