The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) participates as a hosting organisation in the [Google Summer of Code 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023).
 
If you are interested in participating as a student (or just an open source newbie), mentor, or XMPP project, this is the site to start with!

### XMPP - the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol

XMPP is the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, a set of open technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middle-ware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. XMPP was originally developed in the Jabber open-source community to provide an open, decentralized alternative to the closed instant messaging services at that time.

### Google Summer of Code 2023

The Google Summer of Code is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas.
