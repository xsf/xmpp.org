As an organization the XSF relies on the enthusiasm of its members and the generosity of its sponsors to continue its work.

Sponsoring the XSF puts your company in front of an influential and highly technical audience interested in an Open Standard that becomes more popular year after year.

XSF sponsors are widely recognized as significant contributors to the success of XMPP technologies. In particular, funds raised through the Sponsorship Program support in-person XMPP developer summits, travel for key XMPP community members to speak at industry conferences (in particular our very popular seminars at OSCON and FOSDEM) and participate in IETF meetings, hosting and maintenance of XSF servers, and continuing operations devoted to improved standardization and adoption of XMPP technologies.

For sponsorship opportunities please get in contact with us by email via [sponsors@xmpp.org](mailto:sponsors@xmpp.org).

The table below summarizes the benefits available to sponsors at each of the sponsorship levels. Please note the XSF only allows 1 Titanium and 3 Platinum sponsors per year.

An explanation of the benefits, together with sponsorships costs, can be found below the table.
