The 23rd XMPP Summit will happen right before FOSDEM in Brussels, on January 31st and February 1st, 2019!

The XMPP Summit is a yearly event, open to all participants in the standards process, and anyone working on or with XMPP. 

Run as an "Unconference", the agenda is only finalised on the first morning, and is therefore highly fluid. Previous items on the agenda have ranged from low-level discussions on Groupchat to high level discussion on how XMPP is used, and how it can support modern UX needs.

With heavy attendance from many key XEP authors and developers, places are limited, but registration is free. Lunch is often covered by sponsors, and it takes place in Brussels just before the legendary FOSDEM conference.

If you're interested in attending, please review the [summit page on our wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summit_23) that we use for organizing the event!
