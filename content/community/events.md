## XMPP Summits

The XSF organizes periodic in-person gatherings in order to coordinate high-bandwidth conversations, interop testing, brainstorming and planning, and to conduct other XSF business face-to-face. Attending a summit for the first time or considering to do so? This may be helpful: [XMPP summits for dummies](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/XMPP_summits_for_dummies).

You can get a list of past Summits [on the wiki](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Category:Events).
The next Summit will happen next year.
