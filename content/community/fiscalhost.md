Title: Fiscal Host
Url: community/fiscalhost
---

The XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF) previously offered a fiscal hosting programme for qualifying XMPP-related projects. This programme allowed projects to receive donations and reimburse expenses through the XSF, without needing to establish their own legal or financial entities.

## Programme status

As of late 2025, the XSF Board has decided to wind down the fiscal hosting programme and to stop accepting new fiscal hosting arrangements.

This decision was based on an assessment of sustainability, administrative overhead, and long-term capacity. At the scale at which the programme has operated, the effort and complexity involved are no longer justified for the Foundation.

## Existing hosted projects

The XSF is working directly with projects that were previously hosted to ensure an orderly and fair transition. This includes the transfer of any remaining funds and support in identifying alternative funding mechanisms where appropriate.

## Future support for projects

While the XSF is no longer offering fiscal hosting, we continue to support the XMPP ecosystem in other ways. In particular, the XSF is exploring and maintaining lower-overhead approaches to help increase the visibility of XMPP-related projects that are seeking funding, without the Foundation directly handling funds.
