The core specifications for XMPP are developed at the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://ietf.org). The XMPP Standards Foundation develops extensions to XMPP in its [XEP series](/extensions).

Good places for developers to start are the [compliance suites](https://xmpp.org/about/compliance-suites-current), as well as the [technology overview pages](https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/).
