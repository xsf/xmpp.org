There are a number of ways to contact the XSF and/or its members.

If you have a general enquiry please email info (at) xmpp (dot) org.

If you want to enquire about sponsorship opportuntities please email sponsors (at) xmpp (dot) org.

If you’d prefer not to talk to an anonymous email address, many of the [XSF Board and XMPP Council members](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation) can be contacted using the details in their profiles.

Finally you can join in the many [XMPP Discussions](/participate/discuss-xmpp/) occurring on the mailing lists.

The Foundation’s postal address is:

P.O. Box 787
Parker, CO 80134 USA
