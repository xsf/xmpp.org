Although the value and utility of contemporary instant messaging 
systems, like Jabber, are now indisputable, current security 
features to protect message data are generally inadequate for 
many deployments; this is particularly true in security conscious 
environments like large, commercial enterprises and government 
agencies. These current features suffer from issues of 
scalability, usability, and supported features. Furthermore, there is a 
lack of standardization.

We present a protocol to allow communities of Jabber users to 
apply cryptographic protection to selected conversation data.

       <a name="sect-idp758208" id="sect-idp758208">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
Instant messaging has clearly crossed the chasm from experimental 
to mainstream in a short amount of time. It is particularly 
interesting to note the extent to which the employees and 
affiliates of large enterprises have adopted instant messaging as 
part of their daily professional lives. IM is no longer simply 
used on Friday evening to select which movie to watch; it's now 
used on Monday morning to select which company to acquire.
</p>

<p>
While the benefits of IM are clear and compelling, the risks 
associated with sharing sensitive information in an IM 
environment are often overlooked. We need a mechanism that 
permits communities of users to protect their IM conversations. 
This document presents an extension protocol that can be 
incorporated into the existing Jabber protocol to provide such a 
mechanism. We hope that this protocol spurs both interest
and further investigation into mechanisms to protect Jabber 
conversations. We also hope that the Jabber community can 
accelerate the adoption of standardized security mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
In addition to its ability to protect traditional messaging data,
the proposed protocol may also serve as a foundation for securing
other data transported via other Jabber extensions.
</p>

<p>
We use the following terms throughout this document to describe 
the most relevant aspects of the IM environment that we wish to 
address:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
user. A user is simply any Jabber user. Users are uniquely 
identified by a JID; they connect to Jabber hosts using a 
Jabber node.
</p>
<p>
Users produce and consume information, and we wish to 
provide them with mechanisms that can be used to protect 
this information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
community. A community is a collection of users who wish to 
communicate via Jabber. No restrictions or assumptions are 
made about the size of communities or the geographical, 
organizational, or national attributes of the members. 
Communities are assumed to be dynamic and ad-hoc. Users 
typically join communities by the simple act of invitation. 
All members of a community are assumed to be peers.
</p>
<p>
The members of communities share information among 
themselves, and we wish to provide them with mechanisms 
that can permit information to only be shared by community 
members.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
conversation. A conversation is the set of messages 
that flows among the members of a community via some 
network. Conversations consist of both the actual 
conversation data produced and consumed by the various 
users as well as the Jabber protocol elements that 
transport it. Members participate in a conversation when 
they are the source or destination of this traffic.
</p>
<p>
In hostile network environments, like the Internet, 
conversation data is vulnerable to a variety of well-known 
attacks.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other Jabber and IM terms are used in a traditional, intuitive 
fashion.
</p>

<h2>2.
       <a name="sect-idp668304" id="sect-idp668304">Requirements And Considerations</a></h2>

<p>
The proposed protocol is designed to address the specific 
requirements and considerations presented in this section.
</p>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1 <a name="sect-idp669200" id="sect-idp669200">Security Requirements</a></h3>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1.1 <a name="sect-idp669584" id="sect-idp669584">Data Protection Requirements</a></h3>

<p>
A secure IM system must permit conversation participants to 
preserve the following properties of their conversation data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
confidentiality. Conversation data must only be disclosed 
to authorized recipients
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
integrity. Conversation data must not be altered
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
data origin authentication. Recipients must be able to 
determine the identity of the sender and trust that the 
message did, in fact, come from the sender. It is important 
to note that this requirement does not include the 
requirement of a durable digital signature on conversation 
data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
replay protection. Recipients must be able to detect and 
ignore duplicate conversation data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>      
These are established, traditional goals of information security 
applied to the conversation data. In the IM environment, these 
goals protect against these attacks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
eavesdropping, snooping, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
masquerading as a conversation participant
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
forging messages
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Preserving the availability of conversation data is not addressed 
by this protocol.
</p>

<p>
Preserving the anonymity of conversation participants is an 
interesting topic which we defer for future exploration.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that this protocol does not concern any authentication
between a Jabber node and a Jabber host.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1.2 <a name="sect-idp679152" id="sect-idp679152">Data Classification Requirements</a></h3>

<p>
A secure IM system must support a data classification feature through the use
of security labeling. Conversation participants must be
able to associate a security label with each piece of 
conversation data. This label may be used to specify a data 
classification level for the conversation data.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1.3 <a name="sect-idp680368" id="sect-idp680368">The End To End Requirement</a></h3>

<p>
It is easy to imagine Jabber systems in which the servers play 
active, fundamental roles in the protection of conversation 
data. Such systems could offer many advantages, like:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
allowing the servers to function as credential issuing 
authorities,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
allowing the servers to function as policy enforcement 
points.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unfortunately, such systems have significant disadvantages when 
one considers the nature of instant messaging:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Many servers may be untrusted, public servers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In many conversation communities, decisions of trust and 
membership can only be adequately defined by the members 
themselves.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In many conversation communities, membership in the 
community changes in real time based upon the dynamics of 
the conversation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In many conversation communities, the data classifaction of 
the conversation changes in real time based upon the 
dynamics of the conversation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, the widespread use of gateways to external IM 
systems is a further complication.
</p>

<p>
Based on this analysis, we propose that security be entirely 
controlled in an end to end fashion by the conversation 
participants themselves via their user agent software.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1.4 <a name="sect-idp688752" id="sect-idp688752">Trust Issues</a></h3>

<p>
We believe that, ultimately, trust decisions are in the hands of 
the conversation participants. A security protocol and 
appropriate conforming user agents must provide a mechanism for them to make 
informed decisions.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.1.5 <a name="sect-idp689888" id="sect-idp689888">Cryptosystem Design Considerations</a></h3>

<p>
One of the accepted axioms of security is that people must avoid 
the temptation to start from scratch and produce new, untested 
algorithms and protocols. History has demonstrated that such 
approaches are likely to contain flaws and that considerable time 
and effort are required to identify and address all of these 
flaws. Any new security protocol should be based on existing, 
established algorithms and protocols.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.2 <a name="sect-idp691344" id="sect-idp691344">Environmental Considerations</a></h3>

<p>
Any new IM security protocol must integrate smoothly into the 
existing IM environment, and it must also recognize the nature of 
the transactions performed by conversation participants. These 
considerations are especially important:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
dynamic communities. The members of a community are defined 
in near real time by the existing members.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dynamic conversations. Conversations may involve any 
possible subset of the entire set of community members.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Addressing these considerations becomes especially crucial when 
selecting a conference keying mechanism.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.3 <a name="sect-idp695296" id="sect-idp695296">Usability Requirements</a></h3>

<p>
Given the requirement to place the responsibility for the 
protection of conversation data in the hands of the participants, 
it is imperative to address some fundamental usability issues:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
First, overall ease of use is a requirement. For protocol 
purposes, one implication is that some form of 
authentication via passphrases is necessary. While we 
recognize that this can have appalling consequences, 
especially when we realize that a passphrase may be shared 
by all of the community members, we also recognize the 
utility.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
PKIs are well established in many large organizations, and 
some communities will prefer to rely on credentials issued
from these authorities. To ensure ease of use, we must 
strive to allow the use of existing PKI credentials and 
trust models rather than impose closed, Jabber-specific 
credentials.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, performance must not be negatively impacted; this 
is particularly true if we accept that most communities are 
composed of human users conversing in real time. For 
protocol purposes, one obvious implication is the desire to 
minimize computationally expensive public key operations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
We note that, in practice, the design and construction of user 
agents will also have a major impact on ease of use.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>2.4 <a name="sect-idp1548976" id="sect-idp1548976">Development And Deployment Requirements</a></h3>

<p>
To successfully integrate into the existing Jabber environment, 
an extension protocol for security must satisfy the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
It must be an optional extension of the existing Jabber protocol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must be transparent to existing Jabber servers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must function gracefully in cases where some community 
members are not running a user agent that supports the 
protocol.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must make good use of XML.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must avoid encumbered algorithms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must be straightforward to implement using widely 
available cryptographic toolkits.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It must not require a PKI.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Failure to accommodate these will impede or prohibit adoption of 
any security protocol.
</p>

</div>

<h2>3.
       <a name="sect-idp1556720" id="sect-idp1556720">Protocol Specification</a></h2>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.1 <a name="sect-idp1557216" id="sect-idp1557216">Protocol Overview</a></h3>

<p>
Ultimately, conversation data is protected by the application of 
keyed cryptographic operations. One operation is used to provide 
confidentiality, and a separate operation is used to provide 
integrity and data origin authentication. The keys used to 
parameterize these operations are called conversation keys. Each 
conversation should have its own unique set of conversation keys 
shared among the conversation participants.
</p>

<p>
Conversation keys are transported among the conversation 
participants within a negotiated security session. A security session allows 
pairs of conversation participants to securely share conversation keys
throught all participants in the conversation as required.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.2 <a name="sect-idp1559344" id="sect-idp1559344">Definitions And Notation</a></h3>

<p>
The following terms are used throughout this specification:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
initiator. The initiator is the user who requested a security session
negotiation. Initiator's are identified by their JID.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
responder. The responder is the user who responded to a security session
negotiation request. Responder's are identified by their JID.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
hmac. This indicates the HMAC algorithm. The notation hmac (key, value)
indicates the HMAC computation of value using key.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
concatentation operator. The '|' character is used in character or octet
string expressions to indicate concatenation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
security session ID. A character string that uniquely identifies a
security session between two users. Security session IDs MUST only
consist of Letters, Digits, and these characters: '.', '+', '-',
'_', '@'. Security session IDs are case sensitive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SS. This term indicates the security session secret that is agreed to
during a security session negotiation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SKc. This term indicates the keying material used within a security session
to protect confidentiality. The SKc is derived from the security session secret, SS.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SKi. This term indicates the keying material used within a security session
to protect integrity and to provide authnetication. The SKi is derived from the
security session secret, SS.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
conversation key ID. A character string that uniquely identifies a
conversation key shared by a community of users. Conversation key IDs MUST only
consist of Letters, Digits, and these characters: '.', '+', '-',
'_', '@'. Conversation key IDs are case sensitive. Conversation key IDs SHOULD
be generated from at least 128 random bits.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
passphrase ID. A character string that uniquely identifies a
passphrase shared by a community of users. Passphrase IDs MUST only
consist of Letters, Digits, and these characters: '.', '+', '-',
'_', '@'. Passphrase IDs are case sensitive.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.3 <a name="sect-idp1570480" id="sect-idp1570480">XML Processing</a></h3>

<p>
Since cryptographic operations are applied to data that is 
transported within an XML stream, the protocol defines a set of 
rules to ensure a consistent interpretation by all conversation 
participants.
</p>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.3.1 <a name="sect-idp1571584" id="sect-idp1571584">Transporting Binary Content</a></h3>

<p>
Binary data, such as the result of an HMAC, is always transported 
in an encoded form; the two supported encoding schemes are base64 
and hex.
</p>

<p>
Senders MAY include arbitrary white space within the character 
stream. Senders SHOULD NOT include any other characters outside 
of the encoding set.
</p>

<p>
Receivers MUST ignore all characters not in the encoding set.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.3.2 <a name="sect-idp1573760" id="sect-idp1573760">Transporting Encrypted Content</a></h3>

<p>
Encrypted data, including wrapped cryptographic keys, are always
wrapped per XML Encryption.
</p>


</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.3.3 <a name="sect-idp1574880" id="sect-idp1574880">HMAC Computation</a></h3>

<p>
HMACs are computed over a specific collection of attribute values 
and character data; when computing an HMAC the following rules 
apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
All characters MUST be encoded in UTF-8.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The octets in each character MUST be processed in network 
byte order.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.5.1 <a name="sect-idp1586816" id="sect-idp1586816">Overview</a></h3>

<p>
A security session is a pair-wise relationship between two users 
in which the users have achieved the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
They have mutually authenticated each other using credentials acceptable to both.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
They have agreed on a set of key material known only to both.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Security sessions are identified by a 3-tuple consisting of the following items:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
initiator. This is the JID of the user who initiated the session.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
responder.  This is the JID of the user who responded to the initiator's request.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
sessionId.  A label generated by the initiator.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Security sessions are used to transport conversation keys between the conversation participants.
</p>

<p>
Scalabilty is an immediate, obvious concern with such an approach. We expect this
approach to be viable in practice because:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The number of participants in typical, interactive conversations is generally on the order of 10^1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New participants are usually invited to dynamically join a 
conversation by being invited by an existing participant; 
this existing participant is the only one who needs to 
establish a security session with the new participant, 
because this single security session can be used to 
transport all of the required conversation keys.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
User agents can permit the lifetime of security sessions to 
last long enough to allow transport of conversation keys 
for a variety of converstions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Conversation keys can be established with a suitable lifetime.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other approaches, including the incorporation of more 
sophisticated conference keying algorithms, are a topic for 
future exploration.
</p>

</div>

<div class="indent"><h3>3.5.2 <a name="sect-idp1599184" id="sect-idp1599184">Security Session Negotiation</a></h3>

<p>
Security sessions are negotiated using an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key agreement 
exchange. The two goals of the exchange are to perform the mutual authentication
and to agree to a secret that is know only to each.
</p>

<p>
The exchange also allows the parties to negotiate the various algorithms
and authentication mechanisms that will be used.
</p>

<p>
Once the pair agree on a shared secret, they each derive key material from the
secret; this key material is used to securely transport the conversation keys,
which are used to actually protect conversation data.
</p>

<p>
The protocol data units (PDUs) that comprise the exchange are transported
within existing Jabber protocol elements.

in instances of xenc:EncryptedKey as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The Type attribute of the xenc:EncryptedKey element MUST indicate 'content'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Id, MimeType and Encoding attributes of the xenc:EncryptedKey element MUST NOT
be present.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The xenc:EncryptionMethod element MUST be present, and the Algorithm attribute
MUST indicate a valid symmetric key wrap algorithm. Furthermore, the
algorithm MUST be the same as was negotiated for the security session.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ds:KeyInfo element MUST NOT be present. The key to use is SKc of the 
security session.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The xenc:CipherData element MUST be present, and it MUST use the CipherValue choice.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The HMAC is computed using SKi of the security session over the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
the version attribute of the keyTransport element
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the initiator attribute of the keyTransport element
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the character string used to construct the body of the convId element
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These values are then used to prepare the XML keyTransport element; 
this element is transmitted via the existing Jabber iq mechanism:

<p>
The receiver's user agent employs the following algorithm to process each keyTransport PDU:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The values of the version, initiator, responder, and sessionId are validated; initiator,
responder, and sessionId MUST indicate an existing security session.
A version mismatch results in an error code of 10000; an invalid security session
results in an error of 10010.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The payload, which consists of the confidentiality key and the intergrity key, is unwrapped.
Any failures result in an error code of 10012.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The body of the HMAC element is decoded into the actual HMAC octet string.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The HMAC is validated. An invalid HMAC results in an error code of 10011.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>
The ultimate goal is, of course, the protection of conversation data. The protocol exchanges
described above allow the conversation participants to cryptographically protect their conversation data using the conversation keys that they share.

<div class="indent"><h3>3.7.2 <a name="sect-idp1696224" id="sect-idp1696224">The Message Protection Mechanism</a></h3>

<p>
A protected message is defined as a traditional Jabber message whose body content
is extended to include the transport of a cryptographically protected message body.
The two key features are
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
First, the usual body element contains some arbitrary text. Those familiar with the
evolution of email protocols will recognize this trick as the same one used
when MIME was introduced.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Second, the message contains a Jabber x element defining the Jabber:security:message
namespace; this element transports the protected message.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This mechanism has the advantages of allowing transparent integration with existing
Jabber servers and existing Jabber clients.

<p>
The sender's user agent employs the following algorithm to generate the protectedMessage PDU:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Appropriate values for the version, from, to, convId, and 
seqNum attributes are assembled. The version of 
this specification is '1.0'. The value of convId MUST correspond to an existing, valid key.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The actual message body is encoded into a character string corresponding to a Jabber message body element. This character string is then wrapped in an instance of xenc:EncryptedData as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The Type attribute of the xenc:EncryptedData element MUST indicate 'element'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Id, MimeType and Encoding attributes of the xenc:EncryptedData element MUST NOT
be present.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The xenc:EncryptionMethod element MUST be present, and the Algorithm attribute
MUST indicate a valid block encryption algorithm.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ds:KeyInfo element MUST NOT be present. The key to be used is the confidentiality
key indicated by the convId attribute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The xenc:CipherData element MUST be present, and it MUST use the CipherValue choice.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Using the HMAC key indicated by the convId attribute, the HMAC is computed
over the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
the version attribute of the protectedMessage element
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the from attribute of the protectedMessage element
</p>

       <a name="sect-idp1748576" id="sect-idp1748576">Security Considerations</a></h2>

<p>
This entire document is about security.
</p>

<p>
This version of the protocol deliberately incorporates only a minimal amount
of cryptographic choice. Examples of possible choices that can readily
added in future drafts include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for the Digital Signature Standard
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Additional symmetric algorithms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Additional hash algorithms
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, additional credential formats, such as OpenPGP, may be addressed
in future drafts.
</p>

<p>
This version of the protocol includes a mechanism that derives a cryptographic key from a
passphrase shared by a community of users. It is impossible to overstate the security
issues that such a mechanism raises.
</p>

<p>
This version of the protocol does not include a specific rekeying capability. Data volumes
in IM environments are expected to be small, and the protocol prefers to simply instantiate
new conversation keys. It is straightforward to extend the security session protocol to
enable negotiation of a new key.
