### 1.0 Preamble

In September 2006, the Jabber Software Foundation changed the name of its protocol specifications from “Jabber Enhancement Proposals” to “XMPP Extension Protocols”. This document describes the next step: changing the name of our organization from the “Jabber Software Foundation” to the “XMPP Standards Foundation”. The change is desirable for several reasons:

1. Our organization does not produce software; instead, it produces protocol standards.
2. The standards produced by our organization are in general best described as extensions to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

### 2.0 Proposal

The Jabber Software Foundation shall rename itself to the “XMPP Standards Foundation”. This shall involve the following changes.

##### 2.1 Business Changes

1. Change the business name with the State of Colorado and the State of Delaware.
2. Update our “employer” information with the IRS.
3. Update our bank account information with Wells Fargo.

##### 2.2 Bylaw Changes

1. Throughout, change “Jabber Software Foundation” to “XMPP Standards Foundation” and “JSF” to “XSF”.
2. In Section 8.2, change “Jabber Interest Group” to “Special Interest Group” and “JIG” to “SIG”.

##### 2.3 Infrastructure Changes

1. Move the JSF and Board of Director web pages from www.jabber.org to www.xmpp.org.
2. Move the relevant discussion lists (Council, Board, Members, Standards-JIG) from jabber.org to xmpp.org.
