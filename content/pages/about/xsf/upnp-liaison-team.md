The UPnP Liaison Team was chartered by the XSF Board of Directors in early 2014 and consists of the following volunteers:

- Philipp Hancke
- Joachim Lindborg
- Peter Saint-Andre
- Peter Waher

The charter of the XSF’s UPnP Liaison Team is as follows:

> The UPnP Forum Liaison Work Team is responsible for upholding the XSF’s
> responsibilities regarding our liaison relationship with the UPnP Forum,
> which covers work on the UPnP Cloud initiative. Members of this work
> team shall function as “observers” within the UPnP Forum and shall abide
> by the terms of the XSF’s liaison agreement with the UPnP Forum.
> 
> The goals of the work team are threefold:
> 
> 1. Development of a technically strong and appropriate solution to the
> requirements of the UPnP Forum, including the application and
> combination of existing XMPP technologies with domain knowledge within
> the UPnP Forum.
> 
> 2. Review of specifications produced by the UPnP Forum to ensure that
> their use of XMPP is consistent with current best practices for XMPP
> technologies.
> 
> 3. Implementation of certification programs and/or protocol conformance
> testing tools with regard to XMPP or the UPnP Forum’s use thereof.
> 
> Collectively, the members of the work team are expected to have
> expertise in core XMPP technologies, the HTTP bindings for XMPP (BOSH
> and WebSocket), and XMPP publish-subscribe extensions. Knowledge of
> media applications using Jingle is also desirable.
> 
> Members of the work team shall be selected by the XMPP Council after a
> call for volunteers from among the XSF membership, and shall be approved
> by the XSF Board of Directors.
