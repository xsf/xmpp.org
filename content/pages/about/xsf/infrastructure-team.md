- Web server and associated software (lighttpd, MySQL, WordPress, MediaWiki)
- Tools for XEP publication (Python scripts, shell scripts, XSLT)
- Email server and list software (Postfix and Mailman)
- Source control (Subversion and various products donated by Atlassian)
- XMPP server, chatrooms, and bots (Prosody and homegrown software)
- DNS (Bind, with mirrors)
- Digital certificates
- Data backups (provided by ASET at Penn State University)
