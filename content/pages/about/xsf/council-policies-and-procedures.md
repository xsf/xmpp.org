The [XMPP Council](/about/xmpp-standards-foundation#council) adheres to the following policies and procedures (in addition to those defined in the [XSF Bylaws](/about/xsf/bylaws) and [XEP-0001](/extensions/xep-0001.html)):

1.  All XMPP Extension Protocols (XEPs) pass by a simple majority of +1 votes.
2.  A -1 vote is a veto, and the concerns of the Council member voting -1 must
    be addressed before the XEP can be approved.
3.  Unless noted otherwise by the XMPP Extensions Editor when announcing a
    Council vote, the voting period shall be ten (10) days.
4.  If a Council member does not vote within the voting period, the Council
    member’s vote defaults to 0 but the XMPP Extensions Editor shall track the
    fact that the member did not vote.
5.  If a Council member misses three votes in a row, the Council member may be
    subject to forfeiting his or her membership.
6.  The Council shall determine if and when to remove members (e.g.., for
    non-voting). In order for a member to be removed, three-quarters (75%) of
    all Council members must vote +1 for removal.
7.  The Council shall at its discretion determine whether to fill any vacancies
    on the Council, but as a matter of policy should do so if there are more
    than 3 months remaining in the Council’s term.
8.  In order to fill any vacancies, the Council shall call for applicants and
    select a new member from among the applicants.
